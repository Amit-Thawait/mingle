= Net::LDAP Changelog

== Net::LDAP 0.1.0: August xx, 2006
* Bumped version up to 0.1.0, reflecting both code and API stability.
* Silenced some annoying warnings in filter.rb. Thanks to "barjunk"
  for pointing this out.
* Added Net::LDAP::Entry#to_ldif
* Patched Rakefile so it actually runs the test suite. Thanks to
  Daniel Berger for submitting his patch.
* Changed Net::LDAP::Entry so it can be marshalled and unmarshalled.
  Thanks to an anonymous feature requester who only left the name
  "Jammy."
* Added support for binary values in Net::LDAP::Entry LDIF conversions
  and marshalling.
* Supported rootDSE searches with a new API.
* Minor bug fixes here and there
* Some fairly extensive performance optimizations in the BER parser.
* Fixed a bug in Net::LDAP::Entry::from_single_ldif_string noticed by
  Matthias Tarasiewicz.
* Added [reliminary (still undocumented) support for SASL authentication.
* Removed an erroneous LdapError value, noticed by Kouhei Sutou.
* Supported attributes containing blanks (cn=Babs Jensen) to
  Filter#construct. Suggested by an anonymous Rubyforge user.
* Supported several constructs from the server side of the LDAP protocol.
* Added a "consuming" String#read_ber! method.
* Added missing synactic support for Filter ANDs, NOTs and a few other
  things.
* Added some support for SNMP data-handling.
* Extended support for server-reported error messages. This was provisionally
  added to Net::LDAP#add, and eventually will be added to other methods.
* Belatedly added a patch contributed by Kouhei Sutou last October.
  The patch adds start_tls support.
* Added Net::LDAP#search_subschema_entry
* Added Net::LDAP::Filter#parse_ber, which constructs Net::LDAP::Filter
  objects directly from BER objects that represent search filters in
  LDAP SearchRequest packets.
* Added Net::LDAP::Filter#execute, which allows arbitrary processing
  based on LDAP filters.
* Fixed bug in Net::LDAP#bind. We were ignoring the passed-in auth parm.
  Thanks to Kouhei Sutou for spotting it.
* Patched filter syntax to support octal \XX codes. Thanks to Kouhei Sutou
  for the patch.
* Applied an additional patch from Kouhei.
* Allowed comma in filter strings, suggested by Kouhei.
* 04Sep07, Changed four error classes to inherit from StandardError rather
  Exception, in order to be friendlier to irb. Suggested by Kouhei.


== Net::LDAP 0.0.4: August 15, 2006
* Undeprecated Net::LDAP#modify. Thanks to Justin Forder for
  providing the rationale for this.
* Added a much-expanded set of special characters to the parser
  for RFC-2254 filters. Thanks to Andre Nathan.
* Changed Net::LDAP#search so you can pass it a filter in string form.
  The conversion to a Net::LDAP::Filter now happens automatically.
* Implemented Net::LDAP#bind_as (preliminary and subject to change).
  Thanks for Simon Claret for valuable suggestions and for helping test.
* Fixed bug in Net::LDAP#open that was preventing #open from being
  called more than one on a given Net::LDAP object.

== Net::LDAP 0.0.3: July 26, 2006
* Added simple TLS encryption.
  Thanks to Garett Shulman for suggestions and for helping test.

== Net::LDAP 0.0.2: July 12, 2006
* Fixed malformation in distro tarball and gem.
* Improved documentation.
* Supported "paged search control."
* Added a range of API improvements.
* Thanks to Andre Nathan, andre@digirati.com.br, for valuable
  suggestions.
* Added support for LE and GE search filters.
* Added support for Search referrals.
* Fixed a regression with openldap 2.2.x and higher caused
  by the introduction of RFC-2696 controls. Thanks to Andre
  Nathan for reporting the problem.
* Added support for RFC-2254 filter syntax.

== Net::LDAP 0.0.1: May 1, 2006
* Initial release.
* Client functionality is near-complete, although the APIs
  are not guaranteed and may change depending on feedback
  from the community.
* We're internally working on a Ruby-based implementation
  of a full-featured, production-quality LDAP server,
  which will leverage the underlying LDAP and BER functionality
  in Net::LDAP.
* Please tell us if you would be interested in seeing a public
  release of the LDAP server.
* Grateful acknowledgement to Austin Ziegler, who reviewed
  this code and provided the release framework, including
  minitar.
