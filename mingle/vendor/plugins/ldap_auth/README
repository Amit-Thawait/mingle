Mingle LDAP Authentication
--------------------------

This authentication plugin only supports LDAP, LDAPS and LDAP/TLS.

IMPORTANT: As of the 2.0.1. release it is no longer necessary to copy the LDAP plugin directory
to vendor/plugins in order to install.  The LDAP plugin is now pre-installed, but now must be
explicitly enabled in config/auth_config.yml.  See step 4 below.

1. Before you can use Mingle LDAP authentication, you must first complete 
the standard Mingle installation and configuration. Make sure that you setup a 
user with both full Mingle administrative privileges and a login that is also 
contained in your LDAP directory.

2. Stop Mingle server.

3. Edit <mingle_data_directory>/config/auth_config.yml to contain your configuration:

  For Active Directory:

  authentication: ldap
  ldap_settings:
    ldapserver: <hostname>
    ldapport: <port>
    ldapbinduser: <user>
    ldapbindpasswd: <password>
    ldapbasedn: ou=Users,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapfilter: sAMAccountName
    ldapobjectclass: organizationalPerson
    ldap_map_fullname: cn
    ldap_map_mail: mail
    ldapgroupdn : cn=MingleUsers,ou=Groups,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapgroupobjectclass : group
    ldapgroupattribute : member
    ldapusessl: false
    ldapusetls: false
    ldaptruststore: <JAVA_HOME>/bin/lib/security/cacerts
    auto_enroll: true
    auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin: false

  For OpenLDAP:

  authentication: ldap
  ldap_settings:
    ldapserver: <hostname>
    ldapport: <port>
    ldapbinduser: <user>
    ldapbindpasswd: <password>
    ldapbasedn: ou=People,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapfilter: uid
    ldapobjectclass: posixAccount
    ldap_map_fullname: cn
    ldap_map_mail: mail
    ldapgroupdn : cn=MingleUsers,ou=Groups,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapgroupobjectclass : posixGroup
    ldapgroupattribute : memberUid
    ldapusessl: false
    ldapusetls: false
    ldaptruststore: <JAVA_HOME>/bin/lib/security/cacerts
    auto_enroll: true
    auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin: false
    
4. Notice the first line of each configuration above, as of 2.0.1 it is now necessary 
to explicitly state an authentication of type 'ldap' in order to use the LDAP authentication plugin.  

If you have enabled basic authentication, it will also be necessary to state 
that basic_authentication is of type 'ldap:'

  basic_authentication_enabled: true
  basic_authentication: ldap
  authentication: ldap 
  ldap_settings: 
    ldapserver: ...
    ...
    
5. Start Mingle server.

6. Login as the user you configured in Step 1, but this time using the LDAP
password rather than the Mingle password. This user will still have full Mingle admin
privileges.  This user can make future Mingle users Mingle admins if you wish to grant others
that privilege.

7. Any users enrolled in your LDAP directory can now login to Mingle. When they login to Mingle, 
a Mingle account will be automatically created if it does not already exist. 
Once a user has logged in for the first time s/he can be granted access to projects.

If for some reason, you did not wish for Mingle users to be automatically created,
you could set 'auto_enroll' to false in your configuration.  Note that this would require anyone
logging in to already exist in the Mingle database.  This setting would typically never
be used. The default value of 'auto_enroll' is true.

8. If auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin was set to true, any new users in your LDAP directory 
can not only log into Mingle, they will also be made administrators by default. The
default value of 'auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin' is false.

9. New in 2.0: ldapgroupdn, ldapgroupobjectclass and ldapgroupattribute are for group authentication.  
If the user is not in the group specific in ldapgroupdn, user will not be able to login to Mingle even
if user has valid username/password.  In order to disable this group feature, comment out or
remove these three attributes.

10. Should you ever wish to turn off LDAP authentication, simply change the values of 'authentication'
and 'basic_authentication' in the config/auth_config.yml file to the type of authentication you wish
to switch to, either 'cas' or 'mingle' (Note: cas will not work for basic_authentication). After 
restarting the Mingle server, users will then be able to use the Mingle password recovery feature 
in order to set a Mingle password.

11. To enable SSL support, add "ldapusessl: true"

12. To enable TLS support, add "ldapusetls: true".  If the system use self-signed certificate, add "ldaptruststore: <path to your jdk/jre truststore>"; otherwise, mingle will use default JDK/JRE truststore.

13. Either ldapusessl or ldapusetls can be set to true.  All authentication will fail if both options are enable and set to true.

14. Since Mingle ships with a bundled JRE in the Windows version, if LDAP/SSL is enabled and self-signed certificate is used, please
run keytool to install self-signed certificate to <mingle_installed_directory>/jre/lib/security/cacert.  Install
self-security to this keystore on every upgrade.

WARNING: If you are going to turn off LDAP authentication, be absolutely sure that you configure 
Mingle SMTP successfully before turning off LDAP authentication. This will ensure that the password 
recovery feature is available, allowing users to continue to use Mingle with Mingle's built-in 
authentication mechanism.
