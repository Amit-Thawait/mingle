Mingle CAS Authentication
--------------------------

This authentication plugin supports the JA-SIG Central Authentication Service.

1. Before you can use Mingle CAS authentication, you must first complete 
the standard Mingle installation and configuration. Make sure that you setup a 
user with both full Mingle administrative privileges and a login that is also 
contained in your CAS System.

2. Stop Mingle server.

4. Edit <mingle_data_directory>/config/auth_config.yml to contain your configuration:

Please for all options include the slash in cas_uri

Options One:

  If your CAS server use secure connection (i.e., HTTPS) with a certification signed by a 
  commercial signer, use the following configuration:
  
  authentication: cas
  cas_settings:
    cas_host: cas.example.com
    cas_uri: /cas
    cas_port: 443
    auto_enroll: true
    auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin: false

Options Two:

  If your CAS Server use secure connection (i.e., HTTPS) with a self-signed certification,
  use the following configuration:
  
  authentication: cas
  cas_settings:
    cas_host: cas.example.com
    cas_uri: /cas
    cas_port: 443
    cas_root_cert_path: /etc/pki/cacert/cacert.pem
    auto_enroll: true
    auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin: false

Option Three: (Not Recommended)

  If your CAS Server use secure connection (i.e., HTTPS), but you do not care to validate 
  the certification, use the following configuration:
  
  authentication: cas
  cas_settings:
    cas_host: cas.example.com
    cas_uri: /cas
    cas_port: 443
    cas_trust_all_certs: true
    auto_enroll: true
    auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin: false
  
Option Four:

  If your CAS server is using a self-signed certificate, you can import your CAS server's certificate 
  and/or your CA Root certificate into your Java keystore:
    
    keytool -import -trustcacerts -alias "My Root Certificate" -file cacert.crt -keystore /usr/java/default/jre/lib/security/cacerts
           
    IMPORTANT: Please check where is your Java keystore located.  In the example above, 
    the Java keystore is under /usr/java/default/jre/lib/security/cacerts
    
  You can then use the same settings as option one above:
  
  authentication: cas
  cas_settings:
    cas_host: cas.example.com
    cas_uri: /cas
    cas_port: 443
    auto_enroll: true
    auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin: false  
              
4. Notice the first line of each configuration above, as of 2.0.1 it is now necessary 
to explicitly state an authentication of type 'cas' in order to use the CAS SSO authentication plugin.  

If you have enabled basic authentication, you will not be able to use the CAS plugin for 
basic authentication, so you will need to specify either 'ldap' or 'mingle' authentication:

  basic_authentication_enabled: true
  basic_authentication: ldap
  authentication: cas 
  cas_settings:
    cas_host: ...
    ...
  ldap_settings: 
    ldapserver: ...
    ...       
              
5. Start Mingle server.

6. Go to any mingle page and you should be redirected to your CAS login page. After entering
you username and CAS password, you will be redirected to Mingle and will be logged
in as the user you setup in Step 1. This user will still have full Mingle admin
privileges.  This user can make future Mingle users Mingle admins if you wish to grant others
that privilege.

7. Assuming that you set auto_enroll to true in Step 3, any users enrolled in your CAS
system can now login to Mingle. When they login to Mingle, a Mingle account will be
automatically created if it does not already exist. Once a user has logged in for the
first time s/he can be granted access to projects.

If for some reason, you did not wish for Mingle users to be automatically created,
you could set 'auto_enroll' to false in your configuration.  Note that this would require anyone
logging in to already exist in the Mingle database.  This setting would typically never
be used. The default value of 'auto_enroll' is true.

8. If auto_enroll_as_mingle_admin was set to true, any new users in your CAS system 
can not only log into Mingle, they will also be made administrators by default.

9. Should you ever wish to turn off CAS authentication, simply change the values of 'authentication'
and 'basic_authentication' in the config/auth_config.yml file to the type of authentication you wish
to switch to, either 'ldap' or 'mingle'. After restarting the Mingle server, users will then be able to use the 
Mingle password recovery feature in order to set a Mingle password.

WARNING: If you are going to turn off CAS authentication, be absolutely sure that you configure 
Mingle SMTP successfully before turning off CAS authentication. This will ensure that the password 
recovery feature is available, allowing users to continue to use Mingle with Mingle's built-in 
authentication mechanism.
