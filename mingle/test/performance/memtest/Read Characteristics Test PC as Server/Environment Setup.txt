Mingle Server (DB version 40) on TW-issued standard Dell D620 (1G RAM)

JMeter-Server running on the Dell machine to receive load-test-request.

JMeter running on MacMini OSX generates multiple-threads and send tests
to the Jmeter-Server so that it can execute the test.

The MacMini is essentially used for generating threads as the Dell is not
powerful enough.
