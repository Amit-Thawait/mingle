<section title="Introduction">

<p>Mingle 3.1 introduces personal favorites called 'My favorites'. My favorites give you a quick way to view the cards you work with regularly in the format you prefer (i.e. grid, list or other view). My favorites are only visible to you and not the rest of the team. You can share your view with other users by using the the "Update URL" feature. </p>

<p>You can create and modify personal card view favorites in the same way as creating and modifying team favorites. You should just save the favorite using the "Add current view to my favorites...". You also can create personal favorite wiki pages by using the "Add current page to my favorites...". </p>

<p>Personal favorites are managed via the <cref topic="managing_your_user_profile">users' profiles</cref>. </p>
