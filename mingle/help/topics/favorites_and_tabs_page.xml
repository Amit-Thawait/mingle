<topic title="Team Favorites and Tabs page">
	<note>This section refers to the management page for team favorites and tabs - not the process of viewing cards based on team favorites.</note>

		<p>			
			The Team Favorites and Tabs page displays all the team favorites and any tabs that you or other team members have saved while filtering cards in Mingle. 
			Team favorites are a shortcut for team members to quickly access elements of the project workflow that are relevant to them. 
			From here you can also create new tabs in Mingle (based on a favorite), remove an existing tab, or delete a favorite.
