<topic title="Creating a card">
  <p>Because <cref topic="explore_mingle_topic_whats_a_card">cards</cref> are the fundamental unit of work in projects, Mingle provides several ways to create a new card.</p>
  <section title="Create cards with the blue plus icon" file="creating_cards_with_plus_sign" collapsed="true" />  
  <section title="Create cards with Quick Add" file="creating_cards_with_quick_add" collapsed="true" />
  <section title="Create cards with the Quick Add Card" file="creating_cards_with_quick_add_card" collapsed="true" />
  <section title="Add child cards from tree view" file="create_cards_with_tree_view" collapsed="true" />
  <section title="Add child cards from parent card" file="create_child_cards_from_parent_card" collapsed="true" />
  <section title="Using 'Save and Add another'" collapsed="true">
    <p>On card edit mode, there is a link called 'Save and add another'. Clicking this link will save the current card and directly take you to a new card's edit mode. This feature enables you to create new cards sequentially without exiting card edit mode.</p>

  </section>
  <section title="Using Special Headers" collapsed="true">
    <p>You can create <cref topic="tip_special_headers">special headers</cref> using the corresponding wiki page. Once created, clicking the special header links will take the user to the new card's edit mode page.</p>
    <screenshot alttext="Special Header" src="resources/images/add_card_from_special_header.png"/>
  </section>
  <section title="Using 'Import from Excel'" collapsed="true">
    <p> You can create cards by importing from Excel. Learn more about <cref topic="import_export_component">Importing cards from Excel</cref>.
    <hint>When creating a new card via Import from Excel, the 'Number' column is not required as Mingle will automatically assign a unique card number to each imported card. Please note that specifying a card number may update an existing card instead of creating a new card.</hint>
