<chapter title="Plan and share your objectives" collapsed="false">

Simply expand the objective you want to plan and click “Plan on Timeline.” This will move your objective from the backlog to your plan, where you can begin <cref topic="define_your_plan">defining your plan</cref>, adding required projects and related work. (N.B. Once planned, the objective will no longer appear in your backlog.)</p>

	<p>And if you’d like to adjust your objective's schedule, you can interactively move it around the timeline and modify either end of the objective bar.</p>
