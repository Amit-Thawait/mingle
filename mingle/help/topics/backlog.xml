<chapter title="Backlog">
	    <p>Program backlogs allow you to manage all the potential and upcoming work in your program. By using the program backlog you can capture high-level objectives that represent value and will be delivered as part of your program.</p>
	<p>The backlog supports prioritization of your objectives based on relative value and size. Using the backlog in combination with a <cref topic="plan">plan</cref>, which is a part of every <cref topic="program">program</cref>, you can quickly move from prioritizing objectives to planning them across projects.</p>

			   <bullets>
			       <item><strong>Keep your program backlog lean and execute work in small batches</strong></item>
			       <item><strong>Focus on customer value by articulating problems, not implementing solutions</strong></item>
			       <item><strong>Analyze work on a just-in-time basis</strong></item>
	               <item><strong>Collaborate around backlog prioritization</strong></item>		
		       </bullets>
		   </bullets>	
		<p>We used these principles to inform the design of the backlog and its supporting actions: capturing and prioritizing objectives, planning and sharing them with your team, and pruning your backlog.</p>
