<chapter title="Managing Mingle templates">
  <section title="Overview">
    <p>Templates provide a way to <cref topic="creating_mingle_projects#create_a_new_project_from_template">create projects with a pre-defined structure</cref>. This can speed up project creation significantly. For example, suppose you want your newly created projects to have "Story" and "Defect" <cref topic="card_types">card types</cref>. You can create a new template with those card types. Any projects created based on that template will be created with the "Story" and "Defect" cards types.</p>
