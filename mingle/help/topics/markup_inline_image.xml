				<item>When you save your card, the image will also appear as a card attachment. Deleting the image attachment will not delete it from your card content. Similarly, deleting the inline image will not remove the attachment. To remove the image inline, you must delete it from the card description itself and to remove the attachment, you must delete the attachment.</item>
