<topic title="Slack Integration">
   <p>We love teams, and we want to help you collaborate even better than before!</p>
   <p> With the Mingle + Slack integration, we bring to you the best of both collaboration tools. View cards, create cards, assign owners, post murmurs and more - all from Slack.</p>
   <p> Your Mingle instance can be integrated with one Slack team. Each individual Mingle project may be linked with a Slack channel. Currently, a Slack channel may be linked with one Mingle project only. </p>
   <hint>This is available for Mingle on the Cloud only. </hint>
