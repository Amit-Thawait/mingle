<topic title="Managing project team members">
	<section title="Introduction">
		<p>Before you can start assigning cards to people in Mingle you must add them to your project as project team members or project administrators. Until users are granted team member status for your project they will be unable to see your project on the <cref topic="all_projects_page">Projects page</cref> after signing into Mingle.</p>
		<note>Before you can add project team members/administrators, you must set them up as users in Mingle. You must be a Mingle administrator to add users. Mingle administrators and project administrators can grant team member or project administrator status for projects. See <cref topic="user_roles">user roles</cref> for more details about access privileges in Mingle.</note>
		<subsection title="Team members">
			<p>Before users can work in a project you must grant them a team member role (Full, read only or project admin).</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection title="Project administrators">
			<p>You can choose to make a team member a project administrator. Project administrators have full control over the projects to which they are assigned. Project admins cannot manage Mingle at a global level e.g. they ca not create new projects or users as only those with Mingle administrator role can do this.</p>
