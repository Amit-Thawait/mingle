	<section title="Viewing cards in a grid">
		<p>Mingle's grid view lets you view cards as they might appear as real cards on a wall or whiteboard. 
		You can drag and drop cards to update their status, or assign cards to a developer, or close an issue - in fact however your team chooses to work.</p>
		<p>To view cards in a grid, <cref topic="finding_cards_to_work_with">select the cards you want to work with</cref> and then click the <link>Grid</link> link.</p>
		<hint>A great way to use the Grid view is in <cref topic="maximizing_card_views">maximized mode</cref> with a projector. This helps your team collaborate on project kickoffs, iteration planning, project priorities, backlog items and when assigning tasks to team members. 
		This is similar to using a whiteboard or card wall to move cards around.</hint>
