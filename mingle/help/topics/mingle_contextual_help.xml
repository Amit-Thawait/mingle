		<p>Mingle 3.2 introduces view specific contextual help. This in-context help is available on a number of Mingle's major views. As well as giving in-context help about the current view, the contextual help also provides users easy access to Mingle's help and learning resources.</p>

    	<p>To show the each help section click the "Show help" link (shown above) displayed on the view's action bar. If there is no "Show help" link there is no contextual help available for that help. The "Show help" link will be replaced by a standard "Help" link (shown below) which will guide you to content in our help guide.</p>

    	<p>Although we have designed the contextual help tab to be helpful, you may decide to hide some of the help.</p>
