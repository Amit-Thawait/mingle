<subsection title="Create a new project from importing existing projects" collapsed="true">
 <steps>
	<item><p>You can create a new project by importing an existing Mingle project. Assuming you have already exported the Mingle project, you can click the <link>Import project</link> link on the <strong>Current projects</strong> page (the first page you see after installation or logging on - click the <strong>Mingle logo</strong> to display this page).</p>
		<screenshot alttext="Empty all projects page" src="resources/images/installation/create_new_project_via_import_projects.png"/>
	</item>
	
	<item><p>Choose the project export file and provide a project name and identifier.</p>
		<screenshot alttext="New project from template" src="resources/images/installation/import_project.png"/>
	</item>
	
	<item><p>Click the 'Import project' link to complete the project creation.</p>
		<screenshot alttext="New project from template" src="resources/images/installation/complete_importing_project.png"/>
	</item>
  
 </steps>
  <note>Any users in the imported project that don't already exist in your Mingle instance will be created. User passwords are not exported with a project. Therefore, a Mingle administrator will need to create a new password for these newly created users on the <cref topic="manage_users_page">manage users page</cref>, unless you use external authentication such as LDAP.</note>
