	<section title="Objectives">
	    <p>Objectives are a central feature of <cref topic="mingle_plus">Mingle Plus</cref> and represent high-level value that will be delivered as part of your <cref topic="program">program</cref>. Currently, this Objective API pertains to planned objectives only, that is objectives that exist on your program <cref topic="plan">plan</cref>. It does not pertain to any of your program’s unplanned objectives, that is objectives that exist in your program <cref topic="backlog">backlog</cref>.
