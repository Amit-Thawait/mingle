    <section title="Some of our favorite tracking methods">
        <subsection title="Daily History Chart">
            <p>The most effective way to track your releases, sprints and iterations is to use Mingle's <cref topic="markup_daily_history_chart">Daily History Chart</cref> (a feature introduced in Mingle 3.2).  It is a chart showing the increase (and decrease) of a numeric property over time e.g. the number of points of scope for stories in each card status over time.</p>

        <subsection title="Pivot Table">
            <p>A <cref topic="macro_reference#pivot_table">pivot table</cref> is a great way to track your project.  You can specify a property for your rows and a property for your columns to see your release, sprint or iteration from different perspectives.</p>
            <p>Example pivot tables:</p>
            <bullets>
                <item>
                    <p>A pivot table to sum the estimates for in-scope stories by priority</p>

                </item>
                <item>
                    <p>A pivot table to sum the estimates for all stories by feature</p>
