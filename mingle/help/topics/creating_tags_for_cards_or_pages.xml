<topic title="Creating tags for cards or pages">
    <section title="Introduction">
    	<p>Tags are a great way to dynamically group related cards or pages in Mingle. </p>
<p>You can create and manage tags from the <tab>Project admin</tab> tab, <link>Tags</link> link or create tags on the fly from <cref topic="working_with_tags">within cards and pages</cref>.</p>
    	
    	<hint>It's not essential to create tags as a project administrator since team members will most likely create tags as they work on projects. 
    		Your main task as a project administrator then becomes <cref topic="managing_tags">maintaining tags</cref>.</hint>
    	
    	<p>Applying tags to pages gives you extra search terms. Whenever you <cref topic="mingle_search">search in Mingle</cref>, the search results for pages are prioritized 
    		according to tags. For example, if a page has a tag of 'training' and you perform a Mingle search for 'training', 
    		this page will be prioritized in the search results.</p>
    	
    	<p>Applying tags to cards gives you another layer of card filtering when displaying cards or creating saved views. 
    		You can <cref topic="filter_list_by_component">specify which cards you want to view according to their tags</cref> from the <sidebar-button>Filter list by...</sidebar-button> sidebar control.</p>
    	
    	<p>For details about creating tags in cards or pages on the fly, see <cref topic="working_with_tags">Working with tags</cref>.</p>
