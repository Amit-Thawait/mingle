    <p>When you first attempt to view this macro, you will see a message indicating that you need to authorize Mingle to access data from Go on your behalf, similar to below.</p>  
    <screenshot src="resources/images/oauth_authorize_data_access.png" alttext="Allow Mingle to access Go data on your behalf." />
    <p>Clicking the authorize link will open a popup displaying a Go page asking you whether you wish to allow Go to provide your data to Mingle such as below. If you do not currently have a current Go session you will first be asked to login to Go.</p>
    <screenshot src="resources/images/go_allow_oauth_access.png" alttext="Go asks you to allow it to provide data to Mingle." />
    <p>Once the user clicks the Yes button the popup will close and the pipeline status gadget will appear.</p>
    
    <warning>If a user authorizes on a page containing markup for multiple pipeline status gadgets only the gadget from which authorization was initiated will refresh with the gadget content. To show gadget content across the entire page, the page must be refresh in the browser.</warning>
