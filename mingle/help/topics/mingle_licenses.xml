<section title="Managing your license (Mingle Onsite only)">
  <hint>This section pertains to <cref topic="mingle_onsite">Mingle Onsite</cref> only.</hint> 
After completing Mingle installation, Mingle administrators can manage their Mingle instance by accessing the 'License' option from the Admin menu.

<subsection title="Anonymous access and Mingle licenses">

In order to enable anonymous user access on projects within a Mingle instance the Mingle license for that instance must have anonymous access enabled. Without an anonymous access license anonymous access projects will not be configurable and will be inaccessible to all anonymous users.

<note>To enable anonymous access on a appropriately licensed instance see <cref topic="project_settings_page">project settings</cref>.</note> 
</subsection>

<subsection title="Numbers for full and light users"> 
  <p> Each Mingle license indicates the maximum number of active full and light users that can be created on that instance. If the active number of full or light users exceeds the maximum allowed the instance will be incorrectly licensed. </p>

<note>In some scenarios administrators are prevented from exceeding the maximum user allowance. In these scenarios a warning banner will be shown to indicate that no more users can be activated until the license has been updated or the active user count decreased.</note>


<p>Beginning with Mingle 2.3 any available full user seats can be used to activate full or light users. This means that even if you have not specifically purchased a light user seat you will be able to use a full user seat to register a light user.</p>
</subsection>

<subsection title="Incorrectly licensed Mingle instances and resolving any licensing issues">
  <p> Mingle instances that are incorrectly licensed will have limited functionality. There are number of scenarios that cause a Mingle instance to be incorrectly licensed and the impact of having an incorrectly registered Mingle instance depends on how the license is invalidated. </p>
