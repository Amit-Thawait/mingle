<topic title="Mingle LDAP Authentication">
  <p>This authentication plugin only supports LDAP, LDAPS and LDAP/TLS.</p>

  <section title="Installation">
   <note>
	<bullets>
	<item>Mingle supports connecting to a single LDAP server configuration. We do not support configuration with multiple LDAP servers. If you would like to use Mingle with a multiple LDAP server configuration please contact our <exref url="@tw_studios_mingle_support_url@">support team</exref>.</item>
	<item>Mingle supports anonymous binding if your directory is given anonymous read access. To enable it, leave ldapbinduser and ldapbindpasswd entries empty.</item>
	<item>Before you can use Mingle LDAP authentication, you must first complete 
	the standard Mingle installation and configuration. Make sure that you setup a 
	user with both full Mingle administrative privileges and a login that is also 
	contained in your LDAP directory.</item>
	</bullets>
	
	  </note>

    <steps>
	
		<item>
		  Stop Mingle server.
		</item>
		
		<item>
		  Edit <i>mingle_data_directory</i>/config/auth_config.yml to contain your configuration:
		</item>
		
	  <warning>auth_config.yml is space sensitive and you must stick to the indentation scheme specified in these examples.</warning>
	  <warning>Special characters in the auth_config.yml will affect certain Mingle features. If your LDAP password begin with a special charactor, plese quote it. </warning>
	  <strong>For Active Directory:</strong>
		<markup>
  authentication: ldap
  ldap_settings:
    ldapserver: <i>hostname</i>
    ldapport: <i>port</i>
    ldapbinduser: <i>user</i>
    ldapbindpasswd: <i>password</i>
    ldapbasedn: ou=Users,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapfilter: sAMAccountName
    ldapobjectclass: organizationalPerson
    ldap_map_fullname: cn
    ldap_map_mail: mail
    ldapgroupdn : cn=MingleUsers,ou=Groups,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapgroupobjectclass : group
    ldapgroupattribute : member
		</markup>
		<p></p>
		
		<p></p>
		<strong>For OpenLDAP:</strong>
		<markup>
  authentication: ldap
  ldap_settings:
    ldapserver: <i>hostname</i>
    ldapport: <i>port</i>
    ldapbinduser: <i>user</i>
    ldapbindpasswd: <i>password</i>
    ldapbasedn: ou=People,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapfilter: uid
    ldapobjectclass: posixAccount
    ldap_map_fullname: cn
    ldap_map_mail: mail
    ldapgroupdn : cn=MingleUsers,ou=Groups,dc=MyCompany,dc=COM
    ldapgroupobjectclass : posixGroup
    ldapgroupattribute : memberUid
    </markup>
    	
    <item>
      <p>
        Notice the first line of each configuration above, as of 2.0.1 it is now necessary 
        to explicitly state an authentication of type 'ldap' in order to use the LDAP authentication plugin.  
      </p>
      
      <p>  
        If you have enabled basic authentication, it will also be necessary to state 
        that basic_authentication is of type 'ldap:'
      </p>
    </item> 
    
      <p></p>
  		<markup>
  basic_authentication_enabled: true
  basic_authentication: ldap
  authentication: ldap 
  ldap_settings: 
    ldapserver: ...
    ...
  		</markup>
  		<p></p>
  	 
		<item>
		  Start Mingle server.
		</item>
		
		<item>
		  Login as the user you configured in Step 1, but this time using the LDAP
      password rather than the Mingle password. This user will still have full Mingle admin
      privileges.  This user can make future Mingle users Mingle admins if you wish to grant others
      that privilege.
    </item>
		
		<item>
		  <p>
		    Any users enrolled in your LDAP directory can now login to Mingle. When they login to Mingle, 
        a Mingle account will be automatically created if it does not already exist. 
        Once a user has logged in for the first time s/he can be granted access to projects.
      </p>

       <note>If the maximum number of Mingle users has been added to the Mingle instance, Mingle will not create accounts for new users logging in via LDAP. These users will be informed that the instance has reached the maximum number of users. When the maximum number of users is increased or existing users are deleted or deactivated, Mingle will automatically create accounts for new users again. </note>   
                </item>
 		<item>ldapgroupdn, ldapgroupobjectclass and ldapgroupattribute are for group authentication.  
      If the user is not in the group specific in ldapgroupdn, user will not be able to login to Mingle even
      if user has valid username/password.  In order to disable this group feature, comment out or
      remove these three attributes.
    </item>
    
    <item>
      Should you ever wish to turn off LDAP authentication, simply change the values of 'authentication'
      and 'basic_authentication' in the config/auth_config.yml file to the type of authentication you wish
      to switch to, either 'cas' or 'mingle' (Note: cas will not work for basic_authentication). After 
      restarting the Mingle server, users will then be able to use the Mingle password recovery feature 
      in order to set a Mingle password.
    </item>  

    <item>To enable SSL support, add "ldapusessl: true"</item>

    <item>To enable TLS support, add "ldapusetls: true".  If the system use self-signed certificate, add "ldaptruststore: &lt;path to your jdk/jre truststore&gt;"; otherwise, mingle will use default JDK/JRE truststore</item>

    <item>Either ldapusessl or ldapusetls can be set to true.  All authentication will fail if both options are enable and set to true</item>
    
    <item>Since Mingle ships with a bundled JRE in the Windows version, if LDAP/SSL is enabled and self-signed certificate is used, please
    run keytool to install self-signed certificate to &lt;mingle_installed_directory&gt;/jre/lib/security/cacert.  Install
    self-security to this keystore on every upgrade.</item>

  <warning>
    If you are going to turn off LDAP authentication, be absolutely sure that you configure 
    Mingle SMTP successfully before turning off LDAP authentication. This will ensure that the password 
    recovery feature is available, allowing users to continue to use Mingle with Mingle's built-in 
    authentication mechanism.
