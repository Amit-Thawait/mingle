<topic title="Troubleshooting Mingle Installation and Upgrade">	
  <section title="Introduction">
<p> The following sections will guide you through some common installation and upgrade issues, suggesting possible problems and ways to resolve these issues. </p>

<p>If you are unable to resolve your issue <exref url="@tw_studios_mingle_support_url@">please contact ThoughtWorks Studios Support</exref> who will provide further troubleshooting assistance. </p>

<section title="Unable to Start Mingle">
	
<p>	If you see the following message before Mingle has started this may be caused by an incorrect system set-up. Please refer to Mingle's <cref topic="system_requirements">system requirements</cref> to ensure your system is set-up correctly.</p>

<subsection title="Possible cause: Incorrect Java version" collapsed="true">
	
<p>This issue may be caused by running Mingle on a machine with an incorrect Java version. Currently Mingle only supports Java 1.6 (JDK 1.6). 	</p>

<note>	All existing customers running the Mingle server on Mac OSX and General Linux/Unix using Java 5  (JDK version 1.5) will need to upgrade to Java 6 (JDK version 1.6) before upgrading to Mingle 3.3. </note>

<subsection title="How to check your Java version">

<note>Mingle's Windows installer is packaged with it's own version of Java so this issue is more likely to occur on system's running Mingle from the Unix installer. </note>
		
	<p>To confirm what version of Java you're run on your Unix based computer, execute java --version in the terminal.  </p>
	
		</subsection> 
		
		<subsection title="How to resolve this issue">
		  
	<subsection title="To upgrade to Java 6 on a Linux machine" collapsed="true">
	
	<p>Unfortunately there are too many variants of Linux for us to present accurate instructions for installing Java 6 on your particular distribution. However, Sun/Oracle Java 6 is definitely available for most all distributions of Linux. If you Google for "Install Sun/Oracle Java 6 [your linux distribution]" you should easily find clear instructions. Be sure to install Sun/Oracle Java and not an alternative. (We realize that Sun Java is now Oracle Java, but many Linux instructions and package repositories still refer to it as Sun Java.)</p>
	<p>After installation of Java 6, be sure that PATH, symbolic links, start scripts and such are properly configured such that Mingle will be using Java 6 and not Java 5.</p>
</subsection>
	
	<subsection title="To change to a different version of Java on a Mac OS X machine" collapsed="true">
	
	<steps>
	
	<item>Use to SpotLight search for "Java Preferences"</item> 
	<item>Drag Java 6 to the top of your list of Java versions</item> 
	<item>Restart your terminal</item> 
	<item>Try to start Mingle again</item></steps>

	<subsection title="Possible cause: Incorrect database" collapsed="true">
		
		<p>This issue may be caused by running Mingle on a machine with an unsupported database such as MySQL. </p>
		<p>Please refer to Mingle's <cref topic="system_requirements">system requirements</cref> to find out which databases are supported. Mingle no longer supports MySQL. Please refer to Mingle's <cref topic="database_migration">database migration help</cref> to research options on upgrading from MySQL.</p>    
			
				<subsection title="How to resolve this issue">

<p>Please refer to Mingle's <cref topic="system_requirements">system requirements</cref> and <cref topic="configuring_a_database_for_use_with_mingle"> how to configure a database to run with Mingle</cref> to ensure your system is set-up correctly. </p>
				</subsection> 


			
  </subsection> 
  
  <subsection title="Possible cause: GEM_HOME and/or GEM_PATH environment variables are set" collapsed="true">
    <p>This issue may be caused if you are using the general unix/linux build of Mingle on Linux or OS X and start Mingle in a shell with either GEM_HOME or GEM_PATH set as environment variables. This issue will particularly impact machines which have the RVM tool installed for purposes of managing multiple versions of Ruby.</p>
    <p>If you are having this particular issue, you will see a stack trace along these lines in the mingle.log file:</p>
