<chapter title="Using HTML anchors">
	<p>You can direct users to any section of a card or page via a URL. </p>
	<topic title="How to direct to a specific section in any page or card">
		<steps>
			<item>Switch to HTML editing mode by clicking  source tab on the toolbar</item>
			<item><p>Add a named anchor in the spot that you want to jump to (e.g. you want to direct to the “UI” section in your card)</p>
				<code>
				<![CDATA[<h3><a name="UI">UI - Jump to here</a></h3>]]>
			</code>
			<item>In WYSIWYG edit mode, the UI section will have a flag to indicate you have a HTML anchor tag there. The flag will disappear when you save but the text will be blue.</item>
			<screenshot alttext="HTML anchor flag" src="resources/images/html_anchor_flag.png"/>
			</item>
			<item>Now you can easily go to this section of the card via URL. For example, 
				<code>
				<![CDATA[http://url_to_your_card#UI]]>
				</code>
			</item>
			<item>When you open this URL, the card will be loaded and the section, "UI - Jump to here", will be shown at the top of the browser.</item>
