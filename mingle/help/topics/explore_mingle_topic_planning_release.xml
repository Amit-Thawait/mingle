<topic title="Planning Releases, Sprints and Iterations">

    <p>If you plan to break down your project into sprints or iterations, we recommend you use Mingle's <cref topic="card_trees">card trees</cref>.</p>

    <screenshot alttext="Tree view of a card tree" src="resources/images/card_trees_tree_view.png" />

    <section title="Benefits of using card trees">
        <bullets>
            <item>
                Card trees provide additional card views, the <cref topic="tree_view">tree view</cref> and <cref topic="hierarchy_view">hierarchy view</cref>.  They allow you to easily see and manage the relationship between your cards.
                <bullets>
                    <item>e.g. Release -> Sprint -> Story -> Task -> Defect</item>
                </bullets>
            </item>
            <item>
                You will get to use <cref topic="aggregate_properties">aggregate properties</cref> which are great for reporting on descendant cards. 
                <bullets>
                    <item>e.g. calculating velocity for each sprint, counting the number of defects logged and fixed for each sprint or release, etc.</item>

    <section title="Other Tips">
        <bullets>
            <item>Keep your Mingle project simple. Introduce more complexity and structure as you need it. Ask yourself if you are getting value from each hierarchy in your card tree.</item>
            <item>Create a few Mingle projects using <cref topic="quick_project_setup#create_a_new_project_from_template">Mingle's templates</cref> to see example card trees used in Scrum and XP projects.</item>
