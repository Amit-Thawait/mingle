      <p><strong>Reference</strong></p>
      <code>
    Request Method: GET
    URL: /api/v2/info.xml
    Parameters: NA
      </code>

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <code>
    GET

    http://yourname:password@your.mingle.server:8080/api/v2/info.xml
      </code>

      <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
      <p>The above is an example of a GET request to a Mingle server running at your.mingle.server, port 8080. The request locates the version number and the revision number for the Mingle instance you are currently using. All Mingle user types can get this information via API.</p>

      <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
      Upon execution, you should get an xml document that looks something like the following:
      <code>
          <![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<info>
  <version>version_number</version>
  <revision>revision_number</revision>
</info>
]]>
      </code>
