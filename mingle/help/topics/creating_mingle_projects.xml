	<todo>in progress</todo>
	<p>Before your team can start using Mingle, you must create and configure a project. You must be a <cref topic="user_roles">Mingle administrator</cref> to create new projects, and you can create as many projects as you like.</p>
	<p>Create new projects from the <strong>Current projects</strong> page. This is the first page you see after signing in to Mingle.</p>
	<note>If you can't see any options to create new projects, you're not registered as Mingle administrator. 
		Please contact a Mingle administrator to update your privileges.</note>

		<subsection title="Create a new project from scratch" file="creating_a_project_from_scratch" collapsed="true" />

	<p>After creating a new project you can also import existing card data from Microsoft Excel.</p>
	<hint>It's a good idea to first add users to Mingle before creating a project. Until you've added users, you'll be unable to assign any team members.</hint>
	<p>After you've created a project, you must configure the project accordingly. If you've imported an existing project or template, you may only have to modify a few properties and settings. However, if you create a new project from scratch, you must add all properties and settings manually.</p>
