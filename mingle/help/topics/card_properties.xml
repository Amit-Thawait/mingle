<chapter title="Card properties">
	<section title="Introduction">
		<p>Card properties are custom attributes that you can define and then apply to a card type, they are analogous to custom fields. Card properties can be applied to one or more card types, and can have their allowable set of values restricted
in a number of ways. You can choose whether or not to show or hide properties
(so they're visible/invisible on cards), and lock or unlock properties (so
that only project administrators can add or change property values).</p>
		<hint>If you created a new project based on a template, the project will include some card properties by default. You can <cref topic="modifying_or_deleting_card_properties">update or remove</cref> any extra card properties as required.</hint>
