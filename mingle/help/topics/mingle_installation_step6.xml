		<note>Unlike Mingle in the cloud, Mingle onsite does not require password formats by default. However, you can require a password format by setting the "password_format" parameter in Mingle's auth_config.yml file. This setting will enforce a requirement of at least 5 characters, including a number and a symbol character.</note>
