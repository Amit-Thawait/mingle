    <warning>Only delete a project if you're absolutely certain that it will no longer be used. Always <strong>create a backup</strong> before deleting. Mingle gives you this option before you delete.</warning>
    
    <p>The All projects page lets you view all projects for which you are a team member. If there are any projects that you can request membership to or view as a non-project member these will also be shown. Any anonymously accessible projects will be shown here as well. Projects can be set to allow anon access or allow non-project members to view them from <cref topic="project_settings_page">the project settings page</cref>. </p>
