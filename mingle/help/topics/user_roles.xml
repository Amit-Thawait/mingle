<topic title="User roles"><section title="Introduction..." collapsed = 'false'> <p> User roles
determine what users can see and do in Mingle.</p> <hint>You must <cref
topic="creating_user_profiles">register users in Mingle</cref> before you can
assign any user roles. Before registered users can view projects, you must set
them up as project team members (and/or project administrators).</hint>
<bullets title="There are six types of user who may interact with Mingle:">
    <item>Mingle administrator</item>

    <item>Project administrator</item>

    <item>Read only project team member</item>

    <item>Non-project member</item>

    <item>Anonymous user</item>
  </bullets> <p>At the Mingle level, users can either have a full team member role, a light team member role, 
be a Mingle administrator or be anonymous. Mingle administrators have full,
unrestricted access to Mingle and all Mingle projects. Mingle team members (either full or light users) must be
granted access to specific projects (either as a project administrators or
project team members) before they can access any Mingle data. Those users without
any project permissions are either logged in non-project members or anonymous users. They may be able to access projects
if <cref topic="project_settings_page">anonymous access has been enabled</cref>. </p> </section> 

<section title="Mingle administrator" id="mingle_administrator" collapsed = 'true'> <p>Mingle administrators have full control over
an installed version of Mingle. By default, the person who installs Mingle is
the Mingle administrator. This person may add other Mingle administrators as
required.</p> <bullets title="Mingle administrators can:">

<p>Read only project team members must be setup by Mingle administrators or
project administrators. Read only members are project team members who can
view project data but cannot add, edit or delete any project data. Read only team members may be full team members or project administrators on other projects. </p>

<section title="Non-project member" collapsed = 'true'> <p>A non-project
member is anybody who is setup as a Mingle user, but who has not been given
access to a project. They can sign in to Mingle, but cannot access any
projects. They will see projects that have been set to allow logged in users to request membership on the all projects page and can request membership to those projects. Once they are added to a project team they will become a project team member.</p> </section>

<section title="Anonymous user" collapsed = 'true'>
<p>An
anonymous (anon) user is a user who can access a project without logging into
Mingle or without being a project team member. Anonymous access is enabled at
the project level. If a project has anonymous access enabled, users may view
the project without logging in.  </p>

<note> Anonymous access to projects is only available on Mingle instances that are have anonymous access enabled <cref topic="mingle_licenses">licenses</cref>.</note>

</section>

<section title="Full users and light users" id="full_users_and_light_users" collapsed = 'true'>
<p>Mingle users can be full users or light users. Full or light access must be assigned by a Mingle administrator. Full and light users can be assigned access to projects by Mingle or project administrators. Mingle administrators are full users. Full users may also be Project administrators, Project team members, Read only team members or a combination of different roles on different projects.  Light users can only be assigned a Read only project team member role on projects they are assigned to. Light users cannot be project team members, Mingle or project administrators. </p>

<hint>The number of full and light users allowed per Mingle instance is determined by the registered <cref topic="mingle_licenses">license</cref>.</hint>
