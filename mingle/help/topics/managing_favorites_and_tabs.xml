<topic title="Managing favorites and tabs">
    <section title="Team favorites and tabs">
		
		<hint>Mingle allows users to create favorites and tabs that have the same definition as existing favorite and tabs, e.g. same filter criteria, columns/lanes or view style. This will help users who want to rename their existing favorites or tabs to something else using the exact same definition.</hint>
		
    	<subsection title="Card view favorites">
    		<p>Favorites let you and your team quickly access a specific set of cards based on card properties and/or tags. 
    		Favorites also remember the type of card view at the time they are saved, i.e. <cref topic="grid_view">grid</cref>, <cref topic="list_view">list</cref> or other view. 
    		Favorites can be <cref topic="creating_tabs_from_favorites">made into tabs</cref>, allowing quick access from anywhere in Mingle.</p>

    	</subsection>
    	<subsection title="Page favorites">
    		Favorites and tabs can be created from <cref topic="working_with_pages">pages</cref>, so that specific pages can be directly accessed from anywhere in Mingle.
