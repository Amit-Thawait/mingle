		<p>If you want to delete a property value which is used by cards or transitions, you will need to first edit the cards or transitions to remove references to the value.</p>
		<bullets title="Effects of deleting a property value">
			<item>Any MQL which referenced the original value will display an error, this may affect charts and tables</item>
			<item>Any Favorite which used the original value in a filter condition will be deleted</item>
			<item>Any Tab based on a favorite which used the original value in a filter condition will also be deleted</item>
			<item>Any Project variable which was using the original value will no longer be associated with the card property</item>
			<item>Any Card default which used the original value will be changed to (not set)</item>

	<section title="Assign a reporting color...">
		<p>To assign a reporting color to a property value, click on the box in the <strong>Reporting color</strong> column for the property value. 
		Mingle will display a color picker, drag the selection box over the color you want to assign, or just type in the color value if you know it.</p>
		<screenshot alttext="Card property values page - reporting color" src="resources/images/card_property_values_page_color_picker.png"></screenshot>
	</section>
	<section title="Change the display order...">
		<p>To change the display order of the property values, you can click on the <strong>Drag</strong> handle on the row you want to move, drag and drop to reposition it in the list. 
			You can only change the display order for <strong>Manage text list</strong> properties, the display order for Managed Number list properties is always smallest to largest.</p>
		<bullets title="Effects of changing the display order">
			<item>Any filter criteria which uses the comparison operators 'greater than' or 'less than' will now evaluate the relative precedence of that value differently. (see note below)</item>
			<item>Any sort condition that ordered the property values will now sort them in the new order</item>
		</bullets>
		<note>The display order is used to resolve precedence when the 'greater than' and 'less than' filter operators are used with managed text list properties. A value that is higher in the display order is considered to be <strong>less than</strong> a value which is below it. 
			In practice this means that if you want a value of 'High' to be 'greater than' a value of 'Medium', then you should order the values such that 'High' is below 'Medium' in the list. This corresponds to the display order for managed number list values.</note>
