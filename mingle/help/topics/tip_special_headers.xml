  <p>Use <cref topic="setting_up_quick_header_links">special header</cref> links to create new cards with a single click!</p> 
<topic title="Creating and using special headers">
	<steps>
			<item>Create a page called Special:HeaderActions</item>
			<item>Add URL link on this page to create a new card based on card types in your project. For example, to create a link called +Story for card type Story in your project, type in "+Story" and link it to this URL: <markup>/projects/project_identifier/cards/new?properties[type]=Story</markup></item>
          <note>Starting from 13.2.2, the value query and project macros are not supported as part of URL. See <exref url="http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/23699073-Macros-in-URL-Not-Supported-from-13-2">related Knowledge Base article</exref>.</note>
          <note>Make sure you choose the right Protocol. For Mingle in the Cloud, it should always be HTTPS.</note>
