  <section title="Supported systems">
    <p>We have added official support for the following in Mingle 12.2:</p>
	     <bullets>
	       <item>Firefox 10 is now a <cref topic="system_requirements#browser_requirements">supported browser</cref>. (Yes, yes. We know it's already up to Firefox 14.)</item>
	       <item>PostgreSQL 9.1 is now a <cref topic="system_requirements#database">supported database</cref>.</item>
	     </bullets>   
  </section>
  <section title="More search options">
    <p>Building upon the <cref topic="mingle_search">search</cref> improvements released in Mingle 12.1, we now also provide the option to index text, numeric and user properties so you can more easily locate cards that have a specific property or property value.</p>
  </section>
  <section title="See more of your card title on grid view">
    <p>Weâ€™ve made some changes to our grid view so you can see more of your card title (up to 140 characters) without having to open individual cards. While we encourage teams to keep card titles short and sweet--just enough to trigger your memory--we understand that this is not always possible and that seeing more text can help contextualize the card and facilitate conversation around it.</p>
