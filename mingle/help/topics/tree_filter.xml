<section title="Using the tree filter">
	<p>The tree filter is similar to the
<cref topic="filter_list_by_component">list view card filter</cref>, except
that it allows you to set filter conditions separately for each card type in
the tree.</p>
	<screenshot alttext="card tree - tree filter" src="resources/images/card_trees_tree_view_tree_filter.png"/>
	<example title="Some tree filter examples">
		<bullets title="User selects to view cards with Release-size > 30 and Iteration-priority = high. The following cards are displayed">
			<item>All Release cards with size &gt; 30</item>
			<item>All high priority Iteration cards within releases that have size
    &gt; 30</item>
			<item>All stories belonging to the above iterations</item>
		</bullets>
		<bullets title="User selects to view cards with Story Priority = High">
			<item>This would display all release cards and all iteration cards</item>
			<item>Only story cards having priority = High would be displayed</item>
			<item>If a Release or Iteration does not contain a story with priority set
    to High, it is still displayed, but its child stories are not</item>
		</bullets>
		<bullets title="If filter criteria is defined as Release = R1">
			<item>R1 is displayed</item>
			<item>Only iterations and stories which belong to R1 will be
    displayed</item>
		</bullets>
	</example>
	<p>You can choose to hide all cards of a given type in
the tree by checking the box next to the card type in the <strong>Do
not</strong> show section at the top of the filter.</p>
	<steps>
		<item>
			<p><strong>To add a new filter condition</strong>, click on the
    <link>Add a filter</link> link. A new row will be inserted into the filter
    control.</p>
			<screenshot alttext="New filter condition" src="resources/images/new_tree_filter_condition.png"/>
		</item>
		<item>
			<p><strong>Choose a property</strong> by clicking on the
    <link>(select...)</link> link. You will be able to choose any property
    which is associated with the card type.</p>
		</item>
		<item>
			<p><strong>Choose a comparison operator</strong> by clicking on the
    <link>is</link> link. The options available will depend on what is
    applicable to the property you selected in the step above. You won't be
    able to select anything except the default until you've selected a
    property, because the allowable values are dependent on the property
    selected.</p>
			<bullets title="Full list of comparison operators">
				<item><strong>is</strong> - the default operator; will restrict the
        property to only the value specified.</item>
				<item><strong>is not</strong> - will restrict the property to only
        values other than the one specified.</item>
				<item><strong>is less than</strong> - shown when the property is
        ordered. Will restrict the property to values which are strictly less
        than the specified value. Does not include cards having the property
        value equal to the specified value.</item>
				<item><strong>is greater than</strong> - shown when the property is
        ordered. Will restrict the property to values which are strictly
        greater than the specified value. Does not include cards having the
        property value equal to the specified value.</item>
				<item><strong>is before</strong> - shown when the property is a date,
        equivalent to <strong>is less than</strong>. Does not include cards
        having the property value equal to the specified date.</item>
				<item><strong>is after</strong> - shown when the property is a date,
        equivalent to <strong>is greater than</strong>. Does not include cards
        having the property value equal to the specified date.</item>
			</bullets>
			<note>
				<bullets>
					<item>Properties can have a natural order, such as numbers or dates -
        in this case that natural ordering is used to resolve 'is less/greater
        than' conditions.</item>
					<item>Managed properties, where the allowable values are specified in
        a list - use the sort order of the list to resolve 'is less/greater
        than' conditions. <todo>the rule is that the list is sorted in
        ascending order from top to bottom, should add graphics here to
        explain</todo></item>
				</bullets>
			</note>
		</item>
		<item>
			<p><strong>Choose a value</strong> by clicking on the
    <link>(any)</link> link. The options available will depend on what is
    applicable to the property you selected in the step above. You won't be
    able to select anything except the default until you've selected a
    property, because the allowable values are dependent on the property
    selected.</p>
			<note>
				<p>There are several special values which can appear
    here:</p>
				<bullets>
					<item><strong>(any)</strong> - Specifies cards having any value for
        the selected property. Available for operators <strong>is</strong> and
        <strong>is not</strong>. This is the same as having no condition for
        the property at all.</item>
					<item><strong>(not set)</strong> - Specifies cards which have no value
        set for the property. Available for operators <strong>is</strong> and
        <strong>is not</strong>. This is analogous to the 'null' term in SQL.
        It is not available for mandatory Mingle card properties such as
        Type.</item>
					<item><strong>(current user)</strong> - Specifies cards which have the
        currently logged in user assigned to the selected property. Available
        for operators <strong>is</strong> and <strong>is not</strong>.
        Available for properties which take Mingle users as values.</item>
					<item><strong>(today)</strong> - Specifies cards which have the
        current date assigned to the selected property. Available for
        operators <strong>is</strong>, <strong>is not</strong>, <strong>is
        before</strong>, <strong>is after</strong>. Available for date
        properties.</item>
				</bullets>
			</note>
			<bullets title="The available values depend on the data type of the property you selected">
				<item>if you selected the <strong>Type property</strong>, then you
        will be presented with the list of all card types and the special
        value (any).</item>
				<item>if you selected a <strong>Managed List property</strong>, then you
        will be presented with the list of all values that have been specified
        in the managed list and the special values (any), (not set).</item>
				<item>if you selected a <strong>Date</strong>, then you will be presented
        with a calendar widget that will allow you to select a date, as well
        as the special values (any), (not set) and (today).</item>
				<item>if you selected a <strong>Team member property</strong>, then you
        will be presented with a list of the current team members, as well as
        the special values (any), (not set) and (current user).</item>
			</bullets>
		</item>
		<item>Your new filter condition will be applied as soon as you've selected
    a value, and you should see the results reflected in the cards displayed
    in the view.</item>
		<item>You can optionally filter the tree by specifying tags. Click on the
    <link>Add tags</link> link, type in the tags separated by commas, and
    click the <button>Add tags</button> button. Only cards which have all of
    the specified tags will be displayed.</item>
		<item>
			<p><strong>To remove a filter condition</strong>, simply click on
    the <screenshot alttext="Delete filter condition button" src="resources/images/delete_filter_condition_button.png"/>
    next to the condition you want to remove. Again, the effect of removing
    the condition will immediately be reflected in the view.</p>
