<chapter title="Using project variables">
  <p>You can use project variables to update tables, charts and favorites in a single step.</p>
  <p>As an example, you could create a project variable called, 'Current Iteration' and assign it a value.</p>
  <screenshot alttext="Create plv" src="resources/images/plv_list_current_iteration.png"/>
  <p>When you start a new iteration, you can update the 'Current Iteration' project variable and Mingle will refer to the new iteration wherever the project variable is used. Areas where you can use project variables include:</p>
  <bullets>
    <item>
      <p>MQL conditions in charts and tables.</p>
      <markup>
    pie-chart
      data: SELECT Feature, COUNT(*) WHERE TYPE = Story AND Iteration = (Current Iteration)
      </markup>
      <screenshot alttext="project variable in use in chart" src="resources/images/plv_used_in_chart_mql.png"/>
    </item>
    <item>
      <p>Chart and table parameters. In this example, the daily history chart uses the 'Iteration start date' and 'Iteration end date' project variables to set values for the start-date and end-date parameters, respectively.</p>
      <markup>
  daily-history-chart
    aggregate: SUM('Estimate')
    start-date: (Iteration start date)
    end-date: (Iteration end date)
    [chart definition continues...]
