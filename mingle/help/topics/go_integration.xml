<topic title="Go Integration">
  <note>Go integration is available on <cref topic="mingle_onsite">Mingle onsite</cref> until v16.1.</note>
  <p>Mingle integrates with <exref url="https://www.thoughtworks.com/products/go-continuous-delivery">Go, the Continuous Integration and Delivery tool</exref> from ThoughtWorks Studios. This allows the users of Go and Mingle to surround their data with additional context, increasing the value of the information therein.</p>
  
  <p>Mingle's <cref topic="markup_go_pipeline_status">Go pipeline status gadget</cref> allows the display of the current status of a Go pipeline in a Mingle page or card. This allows users to view current project status across the two products in a single view. To enable this integration, please follow the instructions for <cref topic="go_in_mingle"> configuring the display of Go gadgets within Mingle.</cref></p>
