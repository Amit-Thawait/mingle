<topic title="Viewing cross project reports">
         <p>In order to view cross project reports you have to be a member of all the projects that are being reported on.</p> 
         <p>If a wiki page or card is created that displays multiple project charts or tables the user must be a member of <strong>all</strong> projects to view any of the project reports. If the user is not a member an error message will be displayed.</p>
         <p>Ensure that users can see all charts by <cref topic="managing_project_team_members">managing project team members</cref>
         and adding users as project team members so that they can view project data.</p>
