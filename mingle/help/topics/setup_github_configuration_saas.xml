<section title="GitHub integration for Mingle in the Cloud" id="github_saas">
  
  <p>The following instructions outline how to integrate your GitHub repo with your Mingle in the cloud project. You can integrate multiple GitHub repos to a single project and connect a single GitHub repo to multiple projects.</p>
  <note>
    <bullets>
      <item>This integration allows your GitHub commits to be pushed as <cref topic="murmurs">Murmurs</cref> to your Mingle project and, when you mention the card number in your commit message, the individual card as well.</item>
      <item>The commit murmured to your Mingle project will contain a link back to your GitHub repo so you can see commit details and diffs.</item>      
      <item><strong>TIP</strong>: If you <cref topic="murmurs">murmur</cref> at an existing team member (e.g. @user) in your Git commit message that person will also receive an email notification.</item>
      <item>You can integrate multiple GitHub repos to a single project and connect a single GitHub repo to multiple projects, but you must integrate one repo to one project at a time.</item>
      <item>If you’re connecting a single repo to multiple projects, make sure your commit message includes the project id along with the card number (e.g. project_A/#123 or project_B/#123), otherwise the commit will be murmured to the same card number in all of your projects. Use <exref url="/mingle/news/2014/04/18/Clippy.html">Clippy</exref> to help out with this.</item>
    </bullets>
  </note>    
    <subsection title="Requirements">
      <bullets>
        <item>Only users who are both Mingle admins and <exref url="https://help.github.com/articles/what-are-the-different-access-permissions">owners of the GitHub repo</exref> can setup the integration with the Mingle project</item>
      </bullets>  
    </subsection>

    <subsection title="Steps">
      <steps>
        <item>Open your Mingle project</item>
        <item>Got to <strong>Project Admin</strong></item>

        </steps>

	<subsection title="Deleting Webhooks">
		<p>You currently cannot delete webhooks from Mingle. You must delete them from your GitHub account. (N.B. For the time being, even if you delete the webhook from your GitHub account, it will still be listed on the GitHub integration page in your Mingle project.)</p>
