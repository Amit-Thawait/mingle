		<p>A default <strong>relationship property name</strong> will be displayed next to each branch in the tree. 
			This is the name of the property that will appear in the child card, and will hold a reference to the parent card in the tree. 
			The <strong>relationship property name must be unique</strong> within all property names in your project (including basic card and aggregate properties).</p>
		<p>You can change the default name to a more appropriate one by clicking on the name and typing in the new one.</p>
		<hint>You should choose a name that will make sense when viewed in the child card. Since it's possible for a card to be a member of more than one card tree, it may be necessary to include a reference to the card tree in the chosen name to avoid ambiguity.</hint>

                This will insert  a new level immediately below the one you clicked on.</p>
            <p>You will need to set the card type of each new level you add before you can save your changes.</p>

            <p>Adding a new top level to a tree involves three steps:</p>
            <warning>You must perform all three steps in one go, only saving after you have re-added the original parent type (step 3).</warning>

                    <p>Change the card type of the current top level of the tree to the card type you want.</p>

                    <p>Click the <img alttext="plus sign" src="resources/images/widgets/plus_icon.png" /> plus icon at the base of the top tree level to insert a new level below it.</p>

            </steps>            
            <note>So long as you perform the above actions in one go, only saving after you have re-added the original parent card type, then the existing tree relationship properties will be preserved unchanged.</note>

    </section>
    <section title="Remove a level from a tree">
        <p>You can remove a level from the tree by clicking on the <img alttext="cross sign" src="resources/images/widgets/x_icon.png" /> cross icon at the top right corner of the card level.</p>
        <warning>Removing a level from a tree will permanently remove the relationship properties for that tree from the card type. This is not a reversible action, and you should carefully consider the implications for your project.</warning>
    </section>        
     <section title="Save your work">   
        <p>Once you've finished configuring the tree, you can click the <button>save button</button>. Mingle displays the <strong>Confirm tree modification</strong> page.</p>
         <screenshot alttext="Confirm tree modification page" src="resources/images/confirm_tree_modification_page.png"></screenshot>
     	<warning>The <strong>Confirm tree modification</strong> page will provide feedback on the impact of your modifications. You should read the warning before continuing.</warning>
        <p>Click the <link>Save permanently</link> link to modify the card tree. Mingle will return you to the card trees page.</p>
        <p>Once the card tree has been saved, you can go on to <cref topic="aggregate_properties">create or modify Aggregate properties for the tree</cref></p>
