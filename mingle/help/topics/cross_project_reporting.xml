<topic title="Cross Project Reporting">
    <section title="Introduction">
        <p>Cross project reporting allows you to report on multiple Mingle projects on a single Mingle project wiki page or card. 
	
	For <cref topic="macro_reference#data_series">data series</cref> and <cref topic="macro_reference#stack_bar">stack bar</cref> charts you can also report on multiple projects on a single chart. 
	
	This allows you to access data from multiple Mingle projects at once and see the data in a single cohesive view.</p>

        <screenshot alttext="Two projects reporting on the same page - 2" src="resources/images/cross_project_reporting_pies_2.png" /> 
        
        <p>This feature is particularly useful for large programs of work where you can view individual projects summaries in the context of other projects within the same program. </p>

<p>To create cross project reports like these use the macro's "project" parameter at the chart or the series level. Review the <cref topic="macro_reference">macro reference</cref> for more information. </p> 

   	<hint>The <cref topic="macro_reference#daily_history_chart">daily history chart</cref> does not support the use of the project parameter and therefore, cannot be used to create <cref topic="cross_project_card_page_linking">cross project reports</cref>.</hint>
