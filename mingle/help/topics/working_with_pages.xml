<chapter title="Working with pages">
  <section title="Introduction" collapsed="true">        
      <p>Distinct from <cref topic="explore_mingle_topic_whats_a_card">cards</cref>, <strong>Mingle pages</strong> are where anyone can add information on any topic relevant to a community. Mingle pages can be linked to one another to provide structured navigation. 
      </p> 
  </section>
  <section title="What's different about Mingle pages" collapsed="true">
      <p>Like cards, pages are an <strong>integral part of Mingle</strong>. Both cards and pages have direct access to the underlying data stored in Mingle, so you can easily <strong>create and insert graphs, charts and tables derived from live project data</strong> in both. (Learn more about <cref topic="macro_and_mql_guide">Mingle reporting.</cref>)
          You can also <strong>link directly to cards</strong> from pages (and vice versa), and if you embed a MQL query that returns cards in either a page or card, then you will automatically be able to <strong>click through to view and edit</strong> any of the cards listed.
      </p>
  	<p>The distinguishing feature about pages is that, unlike cards, they can be made into <cref topic="creating_a_favorite_page">favorites</cref> and <cref topic="creating_tabs_from_pages">tabs</cref> to allow quick access from the Mingle user interface, the <cref topic="project_overview_tab">Overview page</cref> being one example.</p>
  </section>
  <section title="The Overview tab" collapsed="true">
          <p>The <tab>Overview</tab> tab is a predefined page that is always directly accessible from the Mingle user interface, and typically acts as an access page into other linked pages. 
              Mingle supports the creation of charts and tables in pages (as well as cards) that query the Mingle database to display up-to-date project information graphically. 
              The standard project templates generally have some project reporting in the form of charts and tables on the overview tab.
          </p>
          <p>You can take a look at this <cref topic="project_overview_page_example">example project overview page</cref> to see how that might look.</p>

          <p>Mingle supports the creation of <cref topic="creating_charts_and_tables_in_pages">graphs, charts and tables</cref> that display up-to-date project information graphically by querying the Mingle database.</p>
          <p>The <cref topic="using_the_editing_toolbar">editing toolbar</cref> allows you to access the <cref topic="mingle_macro_builder">Mingle macro builder</cref> and insert templates for graphs, charts and tables via the icons indicated below.</p>
