<topic title="Creating a page">
		<hint>
			<bullets>
				<item>There is no button or link in Mingle for creating pages. You must create pages manually as described above.</item>
				<item>Page names are <strong>case sensitive</strong>, so "My page" is <strong>not</strong> the same as "my page".</item>
			</bullets>
		</hint>
		<p>There are two ways to create a page:</p>
	<subsection title="Create a page on another page or card">
			<p>Create a new link on an <cref topic="viewing_pages">existing page</cref> (the <tab>Overview</tab> tab is a page) or card. While editing a card or page, type the following to create a page called <strong>new page name</strong>:
				<code><strong>[[new page name]]</strong></code>
			</p>
			<screenshot alttext="Defining new wiki page link" src="resources/images/wiki_page_wiki_link_define.png"/>
			<p>When you save the card or page, you'll see a new link. Click this link to <cref topic="creating_and_formatting_pages#editing_page">edit the new page</cref>.</p>
			<screenshot alttext="A newly created wiki page link" src="resources/images/wiki_page_wiki_link_view.png"/>
	</subsection>
	<subsection title="Create a page via URL">
			<p>You can also create a page by typing a new URL directly into your browser's address bar. For example, typing the following will create a page called <strong>demo_page</strong>: 
				<code>
					<strong>http://mingle.yourcompany.com/projects/your_project/wiki/demo_page</strong>
				</code> 
			</p>
			<p>In this case you will be taken directly to the new page and can begin editing its content using Mingle's WYSIWYG editor.</p>
			<hint>
				<bullets>
					<item>A quick way to do this is by navigating to the page list (in the Project admin tab), and replacing the <subst>/list</subst> at the end of the browser URL with the desired page name.</item>
				</bullets>
