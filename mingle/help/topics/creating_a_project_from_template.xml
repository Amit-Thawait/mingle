<subsection title="Create a new project from template" id='create_a_new_project_from_template' collapsed="false">

<p>If you create a project from a template you need to decide which template is best for you. </p>

<p>	You can use one of Mingle's <cref topic="standard_mingle_templates">pre-defined project templates</cref> as a basis for <cref topic="creating_mingle_projects">creating your project</cref>. These templates are based on a variety of common agile methods and practices.

	Additionally, your organization may also have created a template or templates specific to your needs. If this is the case check the <cref topic="manage_templates_page">manage templates page</cref> for details of these templates.</p>
		<steps>
			<item><p>To create a new project, click the <link>New project</link> link on the <strong>Current projects</strong> page (the first page you see after installation or logging on - click the <strong>Mingle logo</strong> to display this page).</p>
			<screenshot alttext="Empty all projects page" src="resources/images/installation/create_new_project_link.png"/>
			</item>

			<item><p>When entering project details, choose the template you want to use as a basis for your project. You can of course choose to make a project without using a template, however that will involve additional project configuration.</p>
			<screenshot alttext="New project from template" src="resources/images/installation/new_project_from_template.png"/>

			<item><p>Click the '<strong>Create project</strong>' link to complete the project creation.</p>
