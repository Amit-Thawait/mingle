<topic title="Subscribing to project changes via email">
    <section title="Introduction">    	
    	<p>Email updates are one of two methods you can use to receive notification of changes to Mingle projects as they happen 
    		(the other way is <cref topic="subscribing_via_feeds">via Atom feeds</cref>).</p>
    		
    	<p>When you subscribe via email, Mingle emails you straight away to confirm that you have subscribed to project changes 
    		that meet the criteria you selected. Each email you receive provides a link that lets you unsubscribe from the current feed.</p>
    		
    	<note>Before you can subscribe to project emails, the project administrator must <cref topic="configure_smtp_connection">setup SMTP email configuration</cref>. 
    		You must enter your email address in your Mingle user profile before you can receive emails.</note>
    		
    	<subsection title="How to subscribe to project changes using email">    	
    	<steps>
    		<item><cref topic="signing_in_and_out_of_mingle">Sign in</cref> to Mingle and select the project with the changes you want to view (if not already working within the project).</item>
	    	<item>
	    		<p><cref topic="viewing_project_changes">Select Filter history items</cref> according to the changes you want to monitor.</p>
	    		<p><screenshot alttext="history filter" src="resources/images/history_filter_side_bar.png" /></p>
	    	</item>
	    	<item>
	    		<p>Click the <link>Via email</link> link.</p>
	    		<p><screenshot alttext="Filter history - watch this" src="resources/images/filter_history_watch_this.png" /></p>
	    	</item>	    	
    		<item>Mingle emails a confirmation to your registered email address describing the changes to which you've subscribed. 
    			You will now receive email updates any time project changes match the selected history filters. 
    			You can subscribe from the email updates at any time by clicking the Unsubscribe link.</item>
