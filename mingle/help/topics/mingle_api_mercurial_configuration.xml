  <section title="Structure of a mercurial configuration resource">
    <p>The structure of a mercurial configuration resource, and its attributes are described below, along with their data type. Also included with each attribute is whether you are allowed to update the value. System generated field like <strong>id</strong> are provided only as information about the Mercurial configuration and cannot be updated through the API.</p>
    
    <api_attributes title="Mercurial configuration resource xml - attributes">
      <api_attribute name="id" type="Integer" readonly="true">system assigned unique identifier for a mercurial configuration resource. This is not a project id</api_attribute>
	    <api_attribute name="marked_for_deletion" type="Boolean">mercurial configuration is a special resource which is not explicitly deleted by the user. Set this flag to true to let Mingle know that this resource needs to be deleted, and the server will delete it asynchronously</api_attribute>
	    <api_attribute name="project" type="Resource"><strong>name</strong> and <strong>identifier</strong> of a project this Mercurial configuration is for; both strings</api_attribute>
      <api_attribute name="repository_path" type="String">the Mercurial repository path</api_attribute>

    <api_reference title="Get Mercurial configurations">
      <p><strong>Reference</strong></p>
      <code>
    Request Method: GET
    URL: /api/v2/projects/project_identifier/hg_configurations.xml
    Parameters: NA
      </code>

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <code>
    GET

    http://yourname:password@your.mingle.server:8080/api/v2/projects/test_project/hg_configurations.xml
      </code>

      <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
      <p>The above is an example of a GET request to a Mingle server running at your.mingle.server, port 8080. The request locates the Mercurial configuration a project with the identifier of "test_project". You have to either have "Mingle administrator" permissions, or be a member of the team to make this call.</p>

      <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
      Upon execution, you should get an xml document that looks something like the following.
      <code>
          <![CDATA[
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<hg_configurations type="array">
  <hg_configuration>
    <id type="integer">23</id>
    <marked_for_deletion type="boolean">false</marked_for_deletion>
    <project>
      <name>test project</name>
      <identifier>test_project</identifier>
    </project>
    <repository_path>mercurial://path/to/your/repository</repository_path>

      <code>
    Request Method: POST
    URL: /api/v2/projects/project_identifier/hg_configurations.xml
    Parameters: 
    hg_configuration[username]
    hg_configuration[password]
    hg_configuration[repository_path]
      </code>

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>

    hg_configuration[username]=mercurial_user
    hg_configuration[password]=t0p53cr3t
    hg_configuration[repository_path]=mercurial://path/to/your/repository
      </code>

      <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
      <p>The above is a POST to create a new hg_configuration resource. The request creates a new Mercurial configuration for a project with the identifier of "test_project". You have to either have "Mingle administrator" permissions, or be a member of the team to make this call.</p>

      <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
      If you were authorized to perform the operation, and the operation succeeded, you will be returned a location attribute in the http header of the response, which is a url from which you can get the card resource that was created.

    <api_reference title="Update a Mercurial configuration">
      <p><strong>Reference</strong></p>
      <code>
    Request Method: PUT
    URL: /api/v2/projects/project_identifier/hg_configurations/id.xml
    Parameters: 
    hg_configuration[username]
    hg_configuration[password]
    hg_configuration[repository_path]
    hg_configuration[marked_for_deletion]
      </code>

      <p><strong>Example</strong></p>
      <code>
    PUT

    http://yourname:password@your.mingle.server:8080/api/v2/projects/test_project/hg_configurations/24.xml

    hg_configuration[username]=mercurial_user
    hg_configuration[password]=t0p53cr3t
    hg_configuration[repository_path]=mercurial://new_path/to/your/new_repository
      </code>

      <p><strong>Explanation</strong></p>
      <p>The above is a PUT to update the hg_configuration resource with a system generated <strong>id</strong> of 24 for a project "test_project". It will change the repository path to "mercurial://new_path/to/your/new_repository". The existing repository configuration will be marked for deletion and a new one will be created with this configuration instead. You have to either have "Mingle administrator" or "Project administrator" permissions to make this call.</p>

      <p><strong>Result</strong></p>
      <p>If you have sufficient permissions to perform the action and the action was successful, you should get an xml document that looks something like the following. The id is changed to 25, which means you got the new configuration resource just created and the old one has been marked for deletion.</p>
