<topic title="Creating a new card tree">
	<note>If you created a new project based on a template, the project may include one or more card trees by default. You can update or remove any existing card trees as required.</note>
	<section title="Navigate to the Create and configure card tree page" collapsed="true">
		<steps>
			<item>
				<cref topic="signing_in_and_out_of_mingle">Sign in</cref> to Mingle as a project administrator and open the project in which you want to create a card tree (if you're not already working in the project).
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>Click the <tab>Project admin</tab> tab.</p>
				<screenshot alttext="Project admin tab" src="resources/images/project_admin_tab.png" />
				<p>Mingle displays the Project settings page.</p>
				<note>If you are logged in as a project team member, Mingle displays the Team page. You need to log in as a Project admin to create trees.</note>
				<screenshot alttext="Project admin menu" src="resources/images/project_admin_menu_card_tree_indicated.png" />
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>Click the <link>Card trees</link> link. Mingle displays the <strong>Card trees</strong> page with all trees setup for this project.</p>
				<screenshot alttext="Card trees page" src="resources/images/card_trees_admin_list.png" />
			</item>
			<item>
				<p>Click the <link>Create new card tree</link> link. Mingle displays the <strong>Create and configure card tree</strong> page.</p>

	<section title="Configure the new tree...">	
		<p>Enter a <strong>name</strong> and optionally a description for the card tree. The <strong>name must be unique</strong> within your project.</p>
		<hint>The name you choose here will be the name by which users will identify this tree, so it should be as descriptive as possible.</hint>
		<subsection title="Add levels to the tree...">
			<p>Select the card type for each level in the tree by clicking on the <link>Select type</link> links.</p>
			<note>Any card type can only be assigned to a single level of the tree, recursive links are not supported.</note>
			<screenshot alttext="Select the card type for a level in the tree" src="resources/images/select_card_type_in_tree.png" />
			<p>You can add more levels to the tree by clicking on the <img alttext="plus sign" src="resources/images/widgets/plus_icon.png" /> plus icon at the bottom of a tree element. 
				This will insert  a new level immediately below the one you clicked on.</p>

			<p><screenshot alttext="Add a level to the tree" src="resources/images/add_level_to_tree_after.png" /></p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection title="Rename relationship properties...">
			<p>A default <strong>relationship property name</strong> will be displayed next to each branch in the tree. 
			This is the name of the property that will appear in the child card, and will hold a reference to the parent card in the tree. 
			The <strong>relationship property name must be unique</strong> within all property names in your project (including basic card and aggregate properties).</p>
			<p>You can change the default name to a more appropriate one by clicking on the name and typing in the new one.</p>
			<p><screenshot alttext="Rename relationship property" src="resources/images/rename_relationship_property.png" /></p>
			<hint>You should choose a name that will make sense when viewed in the child card. Since it's possible for a card to be a member of more than one card tree, it may be necessary to include a reference to the card tree in the chosen name to avoid ambiguity.</hint>
		</subsection>
		<subsection title="Saving your work...">
			<p>Once you've added all the levels you want and assigned a card type to each level, you can click the save button. 
				Mingle will display the newly created card tree in the Card trees page along with any previously created trees.</p>
		</subsection>
	</section>
	<section title="Removing a level from the tree">
		<p>You can remove a level from the tree by clicking on the <img alttext="cross icon" src="resources/images/widgets/x_icon.png" /> cross icon at the top right corner of the card level.</p>
		<warning>Removing a level from a tree once that tree is in use will permanently remove the relationship properties for that tree from the card type. 
			If you're doing this before anyone has used the card tree, then it will have no impact.  
			If the tree is already in use, this is not a reversible action, and you should carefully consider the implications for your project.</warning>
