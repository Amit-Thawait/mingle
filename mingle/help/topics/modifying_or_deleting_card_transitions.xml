transition to be made available by clicking on the links and selecting the
property values. Mingle will display the transition link for all cards that
match this criteria.</p>
			<note>Hidden properties will be highlighted, however
they can be used in a transition in exactly the same way as visible properties
as described below. To see the effect of a transition on hidden card
properties you need to look at the <cref topic="viewing_card_history_and_murmurs">history</cref> for that card.</note>
