			<p>This is the
name which will identify the variable wherever it is used in the project, it
should be as succinct and descriptive as possible.</p>
			<p>The name should be
not blank, should not contain "'&amp;', '=', '#', '&quot;', ';', '[' or ']'" characters, and
must be less than 40 characters in length.</p>
			<p>Mingle will display how the
project variable name will look - all project variable names are enclosed in
brackets, e.g. (variable)</p>
			<hint>While it is possible to use the same name
for both a project variable and a card property, it's probably less confusing
to avoid doing so.</hint>

		<subsection title="Select the project variable data type">
			<bullets>
				<item><strong>Text</strong> - any text value of up to 255 characters in

    which belong to one or more <cref topic="card_trees">card trees</cref>,
    and have child card types in at least one of those trees. This is because
    Card project variables can only be applied to the <cref topic="relationship_properties">relationship properties</cref> which link

the project variable as a value for the selected properties on either side of
the transition.</p>
			<p>If the property is a managed list, and the value of the
project variable does not already exist in the list, then it will be added as
a new value. This will happen regardless of whether the property is locked or
not. The value will <strong>not</strong> be removed from the managed list if
the project variable is assigned a new value or if the project variable is
deleted or renamed.</p>
