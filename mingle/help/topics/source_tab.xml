		<p>
			The <tab>Source</tab> tab lets you browse the project source repository. 
			Mingle automatically scans all files in the repository (based on the directory path specified under <tab>Project admin</tab> tab,  <link>Project settings</link> link), and displays all revisions on the <tab>History</tab> tab.

	<section title="With Team Foundation Server (TFS) configured" collapsed="true">
      	<hint>Mingle does not currently support Team Foundation Server (TFS) repository browsing, so you will see no information displayed on the Source tab. You can view all source changesets on the History tab. If you enter a card number in a commit message (using the correct card keywords) the messages in Mingle will contain links to those cards. Viewing a linked card's history displays the source changeset number (which you can then click to view changes for the changeset). 
	<br></br>
		If you click on the changeset link on the History tab or on a card-specific History tab, you will be taken to the Source tab, where you will see the information below for that specific changeset. However, because Mingle does not currently support them, you will not see source diffs related to the specific changeset on the Source tab.
