<chapter title="Mingle Onsite">
  <section title="Introduction">
    <p>Mingle Onsite is for those companies that want to install, manage and maintain their Mingle installation behind their corporate firewall.</p>

    <p>If you require company data to reside behind your corporate firewall or need to meet compliance guidelines on handling company data management Mingle Onsite should be considered.
    </p>
    <warning>Before you begin, check the <cref topic="system_requirements">system requirements</cref> for your operating system.</warning>

    <p>
      <warning>On a first-time installation of Mingle with program management, you may have trouble navigating to the Program Wall. Existing Mingle Plus users looking to upgrade to v18.1 will not experience this issue. We are working to fix this. In the meantime, rebooting the Mingle server should fix the error. If you still see issues after a reboot, please reach out to us at support@thoughtworks.com.</warning>
    </p>
