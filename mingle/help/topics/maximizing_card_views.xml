<topic title="Maximizing card views">
	
<section title="Introduction">

<p>	By viewing a card view in the maximized mode you will see only the information you care about (i.e. your cards) and remove other actions from the top of the screen when they are not needed. This will allow for cleaner, more useful views when working with your Mingle cards.  </p>
