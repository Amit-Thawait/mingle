		          <p>To use this tool please follow the instructions in the &#60;MINGLE_HOME&#62;/tools/export_import/readme.txt.</p>
		         
		        <note><p>As outlined in readme.txt if using this tool to migrate from one database to another you should:</p> 
		           <bullets>
		         <item>complete the Mingle installation process using the new database settings in their entirety, including creation of an initial user, before running this tool</item>
		           <item>license the new instance</item>
		          <item>create any users who are not associated with a project manually, using Mingle, as they will not be imported with the projects</item> 
		           <item>review the templates after the import has completed to remove any duplicates of the standard templates that may have been installed</item>
		            </bullets></note>
