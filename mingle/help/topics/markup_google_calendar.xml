<subsection title="Google calendar macro" collapsed="true" id="google_calendar">
	<p>Mingle 3.2 introduced the macro to create a google calendar.</p>
	<p>The markup below will display the public Google calendar for US holidays.</p>
	<markup>
  google-calendar
    src: "http://www.google.com/calendar/embed?src=en.usa%23holiday%40group.v.calendar.google.com&amp;ctz=America/Los_Angeles"
    width: 900
    height: 700
</markup>

	<hint>This macro is not available in the wiki toolbar on any cards or wiki pages. Therefore you should manually enter the markup as stated above (or copy and paste) and replace the location of your google calendar as a value of the src parameter.</hint>
