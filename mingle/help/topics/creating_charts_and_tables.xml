<topic title="Creating charts and tables">
    <section title="Introduction">
        <p>Mingle supports the creation of graphs, charts and tables in cards and pages by querying your Mingle database to graphically display up-to-date project information. You can create these by hand or with Mingle's <cref topic="mingle_macro_builder">Macro Builder</cref>, which allows you to insert and customize templates for graphs, charts and tables. To see all chart options and example markup look in the specific sections below.</p>

    <section title="Putting more than one chart, graph or table on a page or card">
    	<p>You can use one or two column layout blocks to organize information in a page or card. In Mingle this kind of layout is often referred to as a dashboard.</p>
    	<p>You can take a look at this <cref topic="project_overview_page_example">example project overview page</cref> to see how that might look with some charts and tables included.</p>
