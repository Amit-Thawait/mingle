<chapter title="Accepting a Dependency" id="mingle_plus">
	    <p>When a new dependency has been raised on a project, Mingle will display a counter next to the <cref topic="dependency_tab">Dependency Tab</cref>. The tab is the central location for a project's dependencies. By linking one or more card(s) to a dependency, you are associating those cards to that dependency.</p>
	    
		<screenshot alttext="dependency tab" src="resources/images/dependency_tab.png" />
		
	    <p>To accept a dependency, navigate to the Dependency Tab and open the dependency. Clicking on the Accept button or the + icon next to "Resolving Cards" will prompt you to link resolving cards within your project to the dependency. These resolving card(s) will represent the work needed to resolve the dependency.</p>

	    <bullets>
	    	<item><strong>Desired completion date:</strong> This date is given by the raising project and represents when they expect the dependency to be resolved.</item>
	    	<item><strong>Resolving card(s):</strong> By clicking on the + icon, you can search for cards within the project to link to the dependency. There is no limit to the number of cards you can link to a dependency. You can also unlink the cards by clicking on the x icon.</item>
