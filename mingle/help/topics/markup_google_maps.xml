<subsection title="Google map macro" collapsed="true" id="google_map">
	<p>Mingle 3.2 introduced the macro to create a google map.</p>
	<p>The markup below will display a Google map for San Francisco.</p>
	<markup>
  google-maps
    src: "http://maps.google.com/maps?ie=UTF8&amp;hq=&amp;hnear=San+Francisco,+California&amp;ll=37.782655,-122.419281&amp;spn=0.329408,0.711365&amp;z=11"
    width: 900
    height: 750
    </markup>

<hint>This macro is not available in the wiki toolbar on any cards or wiki pages. Therefore you should manually enter the markup as stated above (or copy and paste) and replace the location of your google map as a value of the src parameter.</hint>
