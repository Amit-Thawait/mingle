<topic title="Viewing project changes - History tab">
	<section title="Introduction">
		<p>Clicking the <tab>History</tab> tab lets you view changes made to a project over a specific period of time (by default all changes made today). 
    		It includes a complete audit log of all project changes which you can filter according to the information you want to see.</p>

		<bullets
			title="Different team members use the History tab differently according to the information they need">
			<item>project managers may want to see how much work is being completed and to see who has been working on different features or bugs</item>
			<item>testers or QAs may want to see which bugs were fixed yesterday</item>
			<item>developers may want to see what recent changes have been made to the source files</item>
			<item>business analysts may want to see progress or changes made to their user stories</item>
			<item>technical writers may want to see which help topics have been reviewed during the week.</item>
		</bullets>
		<hint>
    		Viewing the History tab is a great way to see the areas of the project you've been working on over a certain time. 
    		You can use this information for time sheets, project reviews, stand ups, or if you've forgotten the name of a card you were working on. 
    		Generally speaking, use the History tab if you know what you're looking for, or you know when you modified a card.
    		Otherwise use Mingle's <cref topic="mingle_search">search</cref>.
    	</hint>

		<p>The Filter history component in the top right lets you filter the exact changes you want to see. </p>

		<bullets title="The top section lets you select">
			<item>whether you want to view only changes to specific project elements (cards, wiki pages or code revisions)</item>
			<item>for cards, the specific properties they currently have or have acquired during the timeframe specified in the top History for: section (i.e. Today, Yesterday, Last 7 days, Last 30 days, In all history)</item>
			<item>specific tags that cards or wiki pages currently have or have acquired during the selected timeframe.</item>
		</bullets>

		<bullets
			title="The bottom section you can use in conjunction with the top section or on its own. It lets you select">
			<item>specific changes made to card properties within the selected timeframe</item>
			<item>specific tags that have been updated within the selected timeframe</item>
			<item>cards, wiki pages or code revisions made by specific people within the selected timeframe.</item>

				<p>With the 3.1 release, Mingle provides a new option, (any value), as a value in the history filter. If you select (any value) for any property listed in the history filter, you will be able to view any changes that have been made to that particular property.</p> 
				<note>This is especially helpful if you only want to know or be notified when a certain workflow you are interested in is changed. e.g. Story status, Bug status.</note>
