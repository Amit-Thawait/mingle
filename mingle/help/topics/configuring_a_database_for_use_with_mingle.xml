  <section title='Introduction and advice'>
    
  	<p>
  	  Before you can install Mingle, you must install a database for Mingle to use. We <strong>highly recommended</strong> using PostgreSQL. Support for Oracle (10g or 11g) is also available but is limited to Mingle Plus only.
  	</p>

    <warning>
      In order that we can offer you the best support, you should <strong>never</strong> directly access the Mingle database. All integrations should be done using the <cref topic="mingle_api">supported APIs</cref>.
    </warning>
