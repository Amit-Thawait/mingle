<topic title="Daily Standup">

    <p>A Daily Standup is a short daily meeting where teams can share status and get help with any impediments to getting their job done. Everyone takes a turn talking about 1) What they did yesterday 2) What they'll work on today and 3) Anything that's blocking them from getting their work done. Long discussions are taken off-line and the meeting doesn't last more than a few minutes.</p>

    <screenshot alttext="A Mingle story wall" src="resources/images/explore_mingle_daily_standup.jpg" />

    <p>If your team participates in a daily standup, it's nice to have your <cref topic="explore_mingle_topic_story_wall">story wall</cref> displayed nearby. Why?</p>
