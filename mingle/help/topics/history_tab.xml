		<p>The <tab>History</tab> tab is an audit feature that shows all activity on a project either today, yesterday, over the last seven days, the last 30 days, or since the project began.</p>
			
		<p>Clicking the History tab displays by default all cards that were updated today.</p>
			
		<p>Here you can either browse a straight list of project changes, or filter changes according to card properties. You can list changed cards according to their previous properties and/or their current properties. For example, you can view all cards that were open yesterday and closed today.</p>
