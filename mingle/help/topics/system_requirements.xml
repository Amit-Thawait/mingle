        <p>Hardware requirements will vary based upon number of concurrent users. The following hardware specifications should be sufficient for most organizations with 80 users or less. For guidance on larger installations, see below.</p>

      <p>
        Mingle can run on any virtual machine which provides any of the above operating systems with resources equivalent to those specified in the hardware requirements. While the usual caveats apply regarding the effect of virtualization overhead on performance, we strongly recommend that the VM running Mingle is given dedicated memory and CPU cores from the host machine so that its performance is not hampered by other hosted VMs.
