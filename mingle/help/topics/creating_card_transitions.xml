		<subsection title="Name the transition...">
			<p>Type a <strong>Name</strong> for the
transition. You must specify a name, and it must be unique within the
project.</p>
			<p>This name will display as a link on cards that meet the card
properties you specify here. It should describe the intent of the transition
as succinctly as possible.</p>
		</subsection>
		<subsection title="Choose a card type...">
			<p>You must specify a card type for the
transition. Once you've chosen the type, Mingle will display the currently
available properties for that card type so that you can configure the
transition.</p>
			<screenshot alttext="New card transition page - select type" src="resources/images/transition_new_select_type.png"/>
		</subsection>
		<subsection title="Choose criteria properties...">
			<p>Select the
<strong>properties that a card must have</strong> for the transition to be
made available, by clicking on the links and selecting the property values.
Mingle will display the transition link for all cards that match this
criteria.</p>
			<note>Hidden properties will be highlighted, however they can be
used in creating a transition in exactly the same way as visible properties as
described below. To see the effect of a transition on hidden card properties
you need to look at the <cref topic="viewing_card_history_and_murmurs">history</cref> for
that card.</note>
			<bullets title="For all property types">
				<item><strong>(any)</strong> - is the default, and indicates that
    transition will be available for any value of the property.</item>

				<item><strong>(not set)</strong> - indicates that the transition will only
    be available if the value for this property is (not set).</item>
				<item><strong>New value...</strong> - you can choose to create a new
    property value if the one you want is not in the list.</item>

    variables with the property, then those project variables will be
    available for selection.</item>

property values.</p>

of a transition, which otherwise cannot be modified.</p>
			<note>A transition
<strong>must</strong> set at least one property, otherwise it would have no
effect.</note>

    the property value will not be modified by the transition.</item>

    be discarded by the transition.</item>

    input a value for a property that is required for the transition to complete.</item>
				<item><strong>(user input - optional)</strong> - will prompt the user to
    input a value for a property that can optionally be set with the transition.</item>

    property value if the one you want is not in the list.</item>

    variables with the property, then those project variables will be
    available for selection.</item>
