<topic title="Card keywords">
    <section title="Introduction">   	
    	<p>Card keywords are used by Mingle to create automatic links in cards and pages. 
    		If you add any of these keywords to a card number while editing a card or page, or submitting a source repository commit message, 
    		Mingle will automatically convert the card number to a link to the corresponding card. The link will display a tooltip to show you the name of the card when you hover your mouse over the card links. This allows users to better understand the context of any content (murmurs or card descriptions) which contain the card links. </p>    	
    	<p>For example, if you have a keyword <markup>#</markup> setup for the project, and you want to create a link to card 123, you can type <markup>#123</markup></p>
    	<hint>Choose card keywords based on the terminology that your team uses to describe cards, e.g. bug, defect, story, requirement, task, risk. At a minimum, it's a good idea to include card keywords that match the card types you create in card properties.</hint>
