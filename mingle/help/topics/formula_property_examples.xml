    <example title="replace (not set) numeric properties with zero">
      <p>The "Replace any (not set) numeric property values with zero" option allows you to specify how numeric property values that are (not set) will affect the calculated value of the formula. By default, if the value of any property within a formula is (not set) then the result of the formula calculation will be (not set). You can change this behavior to replace (not set) values with zero.</p>
      <p>As an example, suppose you have a story card which has properties, "Development effort" and "Testing effort" and a formula property, "Story effort", with a formula of <formula>"Development effort" + "Testing effort"</formula> The following table shows the result of the formula calculation for several different cards, depending on whether or not "Replace any (not set) numeric property values with zero" is selected.</p>

    <p>Card numbers 47-49 show cases where replacing (not set) with zero affects the formula result.</p>
    <example title='how numeric and date properties are affected by "Replace any (not set) numeric property values with zero"'>
      <p>As shown <cref topic="formula_property_examples#dates">above</cref>, date properties can be used in formulas. Date properties are not affected by the "Replace any (not set) numeric property values with zero" option. If a date property that is used in a formula is (not set) then the result of the formula is (not set). If both date and numeric properties are used in the formula, then the numeric properties can replace (not set) with zero, but the date properties will not. For example, the following formula, "Estimated completion" which has a date property, "Start date", and a numeric property, "Duration":</p>
      <formula>"Start date" + Duration</formula>
      <p>The result of the formula, with and without replacing (not set) with zero, is shown in the table below for several cards.</p>

      <p>Card number 72 shows the difference between when Duration does and does not replace (not set) with zero. Card number 73 shows that Start date is not affected by replacing (not set) with zero, because it is a date property.</p>
