        <p>
          By default, no restrictions are placed on password formats.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can enable strict password rules, by setting:
        </p>
        <markup>password_format: strict</markup>
        <p>
          Under the strict setting, all passwords must:
        </p>
        <bullets>
          <item>be a minimum of five characters long</item>
          <item>contain at least one digit (0-9)</item>
          <item>contain at least one special character (underscore is not counted as special)</item>
        </bullets>
