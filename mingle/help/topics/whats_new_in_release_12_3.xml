  <section title="End of Life of Mingle API Version 1">
    <p>With Mingle 12.3, ThoughtWorks Studios will no longer provide support for Version 1 of the Mingle API. If you are currently using Version 1 of the API, you will need to update to Version 2. If you are using <exref url="@tw_mingle_help_base_url@mingle_api.html">our latest APIs</exref>, you do not need to make any changes.</p>
    <p>For more information about this change, please see <exref url="http://support.thoughtworks.com/entries/22029412-end-of-life-for-version-1-of-the-mingle-api"> our related community post.</exref></p>
