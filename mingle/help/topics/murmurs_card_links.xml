<section title="Murmurs card links">
<p>You can murmur links to other cards and pages Mingle. These card links work by using the existing project <cref topic="card_keywords">card keywords</cref>, such as #card_number for a specific card.</p>

<p>In addition to providing links to other cards and pages, murmurs associated with a card are also displayed on the card in the <cref topic="card_murmurs_and_history_components">Murmurs section</cref> of the card. To associate a murmur with a card either murmur from a card or include a link to that card in the content of you murmur.</p>

<p>Card links in Mingle will display a tooltip to show you the name of the card when you hover your mouse over the card links. This allows users to better understand the context of any content (murmurs or card descriptions) which contain the card links.</p>
