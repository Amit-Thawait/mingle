<topic title="Easy chart for Fixed date charts">
    <p>The fixed-date chart is an extension of the daily history chart and shows how much work may be incomplete by a given date.
You can use the fixed-date chart to help answer the question: "What can we get done by date x?". It is intended to signal when you may not deliver everything you planned by a given date. When the actual velocity (average velocity to date) is estimated to create a burn-up that falls short of total scope, team members can have a conversation about which features are ready to be delivered and which may have to be left undelivered.</p>

    <strong><p>CREATE A FIXED DATE CHART</p></strong>
    <p>To create a fixed date chart on a page or a card, follow these steps:</p>
    <bullets>
        <item>In the editor, click on the Daily History chart button.</item>
        <item>In the Easy Charts form, start by selecting the data that will go into your chart. This is similar to the filters you use to make various views in Mingle.</item>
        <screenshot alttext="Fixed date chart section1" src="resources/images/ec_fixed_date_chart_section1.gif"/>
            <p>Click on <i>Proceed to Step 2</i> when you’re done with this step.</p>
        <item>Next, build the chart. </item>
        <p>Please set a valid start and end date for your chart along with the x-label interval between two x-labels.</p>
        <p>Select the aggregation for this chart. It could be the number of cards or an aggregation of numeric type card property.</p>
        <screenshot alttext="Fixed date chart section2" src="resources/images/ec_fixed_date_chart_section2.gif"/>
        <item>The Fixed date chart requires that you specify atleast two series. Click on the Add a Series button to get started. Once, you add the second series, you will see an option to convert this chart to a Fixed date chart. Select the corresponding checkbox and define the series that would be your Total Scope and Completion.You have to provide a Target release date.</item>
        <p>You can customize how this series should look. When you’re done, you could either Add Another Series, or Proceed to Step 3.</p>
            <screenshot alttext="Fixed date chart section3" src="resources/images/ec_fixed_date_chart_section3.gif"/>
        <item>Customize how you want the chart to look. You can select a size, the angle of the X-axis labels, and a color for the series. Additionally, you can give the chart, the X-axis and the Y-axis titles of your choice.</item>
        <p>Click on Insert to complete the chart and insert it into the page or card.</p>
        <item>Fixed date chart uses your project’s history to plot the chart. It looks at the events in your project. You will see the chart trying to prepare the data after you save it on a page/card. On refreshing the page, you will see the chart making progress for the series that you have added.</item>

    </bullets>
    <strong>Notes</strong>
    <bullets>
        <item>You can use project variables in your chart setup. For instance, if you’d like the fixed date chart to represent work for the current release at any point of time, you can do so without having to update the chart each release! You will have to use the project variables by editing the MQL after the chart is created.</item>
        <item>If you’re inserting a daily history chart into a card description, you can refer to the card itself in your chart setup by selecting THIS CARD as a property value. For instance, if you want a fixed date chart in a Release card to represent the number of story cards, use Release is THIS CARD in the filters.</item>

    </bullets>
    <p>
        <strong>CUSTOMIZE USING MQL:</strong>
    </p>
    <p>You can build or further customize a fixed date chart using Mingle Query Language. Here’s a sample MQL snippet:</p>
    <markup>
    daily-history-chart
    aggregate: count(*)
    chart-conditions: type = story  AND status > new AND release = (current release)
    start-date: 16-january-2012
    end-date: 14-may-2012
    x-labels-step: 28
    chart-height: 310
    chart-width: 800
    plot-width: 610
    y-title: Estimate
    scope-series: All Stories
    completion-series: Completed Stories
    target-release-date: 24-April-2012
    series:
    - label: All Stories
      color: #808080
      line-width: 2
    - label: Completed Stories
      color: red
      conditions: 'status' = 'closed'
      line-width: 2
    </markup>
    <p>Some additional customizations you can set up in MQL are:</p>
    <bullets>
        <item>Use relationship operators on non-numeric properties (where ‘Due Date’ is greater than ‘Release Date’)</item>
        <item>Custom chart width and height</item>
        <item>Custom colours</item>
    </bullets>
