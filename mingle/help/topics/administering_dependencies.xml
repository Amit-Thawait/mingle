<chapter title="Administering Dependencies" id="mingle_plus">
		<p>You can manage what projects have the ability to raise and resolve dependencies at the program and project level.</p>

		<section title="Enabling/disabling dependencies in a Program">
			<p>When a project is added to a program, it will automatically have dependencies enabled. This means that any other project within the same program will be able to raise and resolve dependencies on that project and vice versa. If for some reason you do not want a particular project to resolve dependencies within the program, then uncheck the "Accepts Dependencies" checkbox.</p>

		<section title="Enabling/disabling dependencies in a project">
			<p>If there are projects that do not belong to any programs, but you still want this project to resolve dependencies, you can do so by changing the "Dependencies Settings" in the advanced settings of the Project Admin tab.</p>
