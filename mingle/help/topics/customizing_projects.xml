<topic title="Customizing projects">
  <section title="Introduction">
    <p>Before your team can start using Mingle, you must create a new project and configure its parameters.</p>

    <p>We've designed Mingle to be extremely flexible so you can adapt the application to your project's structure, methodologies and team preferences. On one hand, this means that Mingle is extremely powerful. On the other hand, it means you need to spend some time thinking about your project's structure and then configure Mingle accordingly.</p>

    <hint>We've included some <cref topic="standard_mingle_templates">project templates</cref> to help your team get started quickly. Choose the closest match to your team's environment and edit the parameters to fit your team.</hint>
