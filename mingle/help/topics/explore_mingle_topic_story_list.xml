<topic title="Story List">

    <p>Managing your "story list" or "product backlog" in Mingle is easy.  Mingle allows you to model your business vision (ideas and features) in a way that makes sense to you.  You can customize different levels of granularity, e.g. epics, features, stories, tasks, etc.</p>

    <p>Once you determine how you want to <cref topic="explore_mingle_topic_feature_breakdown">break down your features</cref> and assuming you know how to <cref topic="filter_list_by_component">filter your cards</cref>, you will have several different <cref topic="viewing_cards">view options</cref> to see your story list:</p>

    <bullets>
        <item><cref topic="list_view">list view</cref></item>
        <item><cref topic="grid_view">grid view</cref></item>
        <item><cref topic="tree_view">tree view</cref> (if you use card trees)</item>
        <item><cref topic="hierarchy_view">hierarchy view</cref> (if you use card trees)</item>
    </bullets>

    <p>You can toggle back and forth between the view options based on what you need to do. </p>

    <p>Here is a story list displayed in the hierarchy view:</p>

    <p>Here is the same story list displayed in the tree view:</p>

            <item>Create either a <cref topic="creating_a_favorite_card_view">team favorite</cref> or a <cref topic="managing_my_favorites">my favorite</cref> to easily navigate to your story list.</item>
            <item>Using the grid view, you can also use the <cref topic="grid_view#group_cards">group by</cref>, <cref topic="grid_view#sort_cards">sort by</cref> and <cref topic="grid_view#color_cards">color by</cref> actions to help you see your story list from different perspectives and <cref topic="card_rankings">rank the cards</cref> in your story list.</item>
            <item>Using the tree view allows you to easily drag and drop cards within your story list.</item>
