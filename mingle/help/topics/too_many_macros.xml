<topic title="Too many macros?">
<section title="Why do I get this message?">
	<p>Loading a card or a wiki page that contains more than 10 macros will slow down your system. Thus, when you visit such a card or a page, Mingle will provide a message to notify you. You can hide the message, but when you go to another card that has more than 10 macros, this message will appear again. However, once you reduce the number of macros down to 10, this message will disappear from that card or wiki page. </p>
	<screenshot alttext="Too many macros" src="resources/images/too_many_macros.png"></screenshot>
	<p>Below is the list of the macros that are impacted. If you have more than 10 of the macros below in a card or a wiki page, you will be informed with the above message.</p>
