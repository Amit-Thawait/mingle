  <p><strong>Custom macros (advanced):</strong> If you have <cref topic="building_your_own_macro">custom macros</cref>, you may be interested in the following changes. Due to some changes to Mingle's infrastructure, we recommend the following changes for custom macros:
<bullets>
  <item>Explicitly require all files (aka classes) that the macro needs in init.rb.</item>
  <item>Be careful about class instance variables. Storing instance variables in the class object may yield unexpected thread-safe results. You may want to use the Thread local space instead.</item>
