  <p><strong>AJP support end-of-life:</strong> Starting with Mingle 3.3, Mingle will no longer support the AJP connector. If you have previously configured Mingle to use the AJP connector in the mingle.properties file, you will have to remove it there. Also, in your Apache configuration, instead of mod_jk and mod_proxy_ajp, you will have to set up a different reverse proxy such as mod_proxy. Please go to <cref topic="apache">the Mingle Apache page</cref> to see some recommendations on how to set up mod_proxy on Apache.</p>
