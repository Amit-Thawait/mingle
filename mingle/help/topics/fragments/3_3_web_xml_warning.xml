  <p><strong>The web.xml file has undergone big changes</strong>. Some changes in previous versions of Mingle's web.xml file no longer apply in this version of Mingle. If you have made custom changes in your web.xml, we advise you backup your web.xml file and start using the one that comes from the default Mingle 3.3.1 installation, then only transfer your old custom web.xml changes back to the web.xml file if the same setting still exist in the new web.xml. This file is located in the [mingle_installation]/config/ directory.</p>
  <warning>Mingle 3.3+ will NOT start properly if you are using a web.xml file from older versions of Mingle.</warning>
