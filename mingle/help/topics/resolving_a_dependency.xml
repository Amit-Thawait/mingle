<chapter title="Resolving a Dependency" id="mingle_plus">
		<p>To mark a dependency as resolved, simply open the dependency and click on the Resolve button. This will change the dependency status to resolved and the raising project will be notified by the dependency icon on the card in their project.</p>

		<p>There may be times where a resolved dependency has not been completely finished. In these situations, dependencies can be pulled back into the Accepted status by opening the resolved dependency and clicking Unresolve. This will move the dependency back into Accepted.</p>
