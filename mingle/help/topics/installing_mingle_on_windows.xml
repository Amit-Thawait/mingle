		<steps>			
			<item>Double-click the Mingle installer file and follow the prompts to install Mingle.</item>
			<item>
				<p>During installation, Mingle will ask you to:</p>		
				<bullets>
				  <item>select a destination directory. This is where Mingle will be installed.</item>
					<item>select a data directory to store data. This is where Mingle will store project data including configuration files and attachments. It is not the database location.</item>
					<item>select a swap directory to store temporary data. This will act as a tmp space in which to store intermediate data such as project exports (.mingle files) while they are being created, project import files that are being imported, excel import content that is being processed for preview and excel import content that is being processed for import.</item>
					<item>select a config directory to store configuration data. This is where Mingle will store project configuration files such as database.yml. This is not the database location.</item>
					<item>select a port from which to run Mingle. The default for this is '8080' but you can set it to any port that is not currently being used.</item>
				</bullets>
				<hint>If you have previously installed Mingle in the selected destination directory, all Mingle files from the existing instance will be deleted <strong>except</strong> log files, cache and any contents in /vendor/plugins.</hint>
