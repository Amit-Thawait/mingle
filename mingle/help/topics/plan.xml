	<section title="What are plans?" id="plan">
		<p>A plan is part of a <cref topic="program">Mingle program</cref>. It provides collaboration and visibility across multiple, independent teams, helping them coordinate work and adapt plans as they progress. To develop the plan workspace, we followed four main principles:</p>
		   <bullets>
			   <bullets>
			       <item><strong>Encourage transparency and collaboration</strong></item>
			       <item><strong>Encourage focus on customer value</strong></item>
			       <item><strong>Provide realistic information</strong></item>
                   <item><strong>Support each team's unique and evolving process</strong></item>

	<section title="What do plans support?">
		<p>Plans help you coordinate collaboration across teams, communicate shared goals, and adapt your program as work progresses by allowing you to define your plan, check its status and progress, and identify whom to talk to as it changes. As you perform these actions, Mingle Plus provides realistic information to support visibility and collaboration, focus on delivering value, and your teamsâ€™ unique and evolving processes.</p>
