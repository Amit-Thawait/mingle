<section title="Basic Authentication"> 
	<p>To enable Basic authentication, you need to set the <config>basic_authentication_enabled</config> configuration option to true in the <path><subst>Mingle data directory</subst>/config/auth_config.yml</path> file, where <subst>Mingle data directory</subst> is the path to the Mingle data directory:</p>
	<markup> basic_authentication_enabled: true</markup>
	<p>Here's an example:</p>
	  <markup>
	    require "uri"
      require "net/http"

      url = "http://your-org.mingle-api.thoughtworks.com/api/v2/projects.xml"

      uri = URI.parse(url)
      http = Net::HTTP.new(uri.host, uri.port)
      request = Net::HTTP::Get.new(uri.request_uri)
      request.basic_auth("username", "password")

      puts http.request(request)
