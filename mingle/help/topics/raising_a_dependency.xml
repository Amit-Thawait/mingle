	    <bullets>
	    	<item><strong>Name:</strong> The dependency name</item>
	    	<item><strong>Description:</strong> Enter any requirements or additional details regarding the dependency here. The description can also be edited once the dependency has been created.</item>
	    	<item><strong>Desired completion date:</strong> Enter the date that you would like to see the dependency resolved by. This helps the resolving project understand the timeline when accepting dependencies.</item>
	    	<item><strong>Project:</strong> Select the project that you would like to raise the dependency on.</item>
