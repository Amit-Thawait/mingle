		<p>The team favorites component lets you open a previously saved team favorite or save the current view as a team favorite. If you save the current view with the same name as a previously saved team favorite, Mingle updates the existing team favorite.</p>			
		<hint>You can create new tabs in Mingle based on team favorites. When you create a tab based on a favorite, you will no longer see that favorite in the list of favorites.</hint>
