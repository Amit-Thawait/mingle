            <item>The <strong>name</strong> is what users will see when they view the card. The property name should be descriptive, but not excessively long or it will take up too much space in tables.</item>
            <item>The <strong>description</strong> will be displayed alongside the property name in the list of all card properties. 
                It can be useful to help users to understand the scope and intention of the property - and prevent it being assigned to inappropriate card types.</item>
