<topic title="What's a card?">

    <p>A Mingle Card is a unit of work in your project that you want to track and manage.  Let's say your project needs to track Stories and Defects.  Then in Mingle, every Story and Defect is a Card.  Mingle allows you to structure your project any way you want so you could use Cards to track features, requirements, technical tasks, or any other kind of work you can think of.</p>

    <p>For Story Cards, you might be interested in attributes like owner, status and estimate.  For Defect Cards, you might be interested in owner and status, but not in estimate.  You may also be interested in additional attributes.  You differentiate a Story Card from a Defect Card by setting up two different <cref topic="quick_project_setup#quick_project_setup_card_types">card types</cref>.</p>

    <p>So what's a Card?</p>

    <bullets>
        <item>
            A representation of all the work you want to manage and track in your project.
        </item>
        <item>
            Each Card has a card type which defines the structure for the card.

    <p>Here are a few example projects and their card types.</p>
