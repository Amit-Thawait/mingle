    <p>Mingle's Hierarchy view displays cards in a tree as a hierarchical list. The following screenshot shows an example of the hierarchy view. In this example, Release 1 has been expanded to show the iterations in the release. Iteration 2 has also been expanded to show the stories in that iteration. Iteration 1 is collapsed to hide the stories in that iteration.</p>
    <screenshot alttext="Hierarchy view example" src="resources/images/hierarchy_view_example.png" />
    <p>To view cards in a hierarchy, select the card tree in the <strong>Select tree</strong> control, <cref topic="tree_filter">select the cards you want to work with</cref> and then click the <link>Hierarchy</link> link.</p>
    <note>The <button>hierarchy view</button> button is only available when you have a card tree selected.</note>
